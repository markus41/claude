# Jira Issue Orchestration

You are initiating work on a **Jira issue** with full orchestration. This command fetches the issue, creates a comprehensive execution plan, and coordinates sub-agents through all 6 phases.

## Issue Details

**Issue Key:** ${issue_key}

## Step 1: Validate and Fetch Issue

First, validate the issue key format and fetch the issue from Jira.

### Actions:
```
1. Validate issue key matches pattern: [A-Z]+-[0-9]+ (e.g., ABC-123, PROJ-456)
2. If invalid format, respond with error and exit
3. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue with issue_key parameter
4. Extract all relevant fields:
   - summary: Issue title
   - description: Full description
   - issuetype: Bug, Story, Task, Epic, etc.
   - status: Current status
   - priority: Issue priority
   - assignee: Assigned user
   - reporter: Reporter
   - labels: All labels
   - components: Components
   - fixVersions: Target versions
   - customfield_*: Story points, acceptance criteria, etc.
   - subtasks: All subtasks
   - parent: Parent issue if exists
5. If issue not found, respond with error and exit
```

## Step 2: Update Jira Status to "In Progress"

Before starting work, transition the issue to "In Progress".

### Actions:
```
1. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_transition_issue
2. Set status to "In Progress"
3. Add initial comment: "Starting orchestrated development with Claude Code"
```

## Step 3: Create Orchestration Plan

Based on the issue type, create an appropriate orchestration strategy.

### Issue Type Strategies:

## Step 4: Execute 6-Phase Protocol

Run the mandatory orchestration protocol with the agents defined above.

### Mandatory Protocol:
```
EXPLORE (2+ agents) → PLAN (1-2) → CODE (2-4) → TEST (2-3) → FIX (1-2) → DOCUMENT (1-2)
```

### Phase Execution Guidelines:

**DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENT:** At each phase completion:
1. Create/update Confluence documentation via `confluence-documentation-creator` agent
2. Log phase completion to PR comments via `pr-documentation-logger` agent
3. Post update to Jira issue with Confluence links

📋 PR LOG: "Phase 6: DOCUMENT completed - 4 Confluence pages created"
```

## Step 5: Create Pull Request

Once all phases are complete and tests pass, create a PR.

### Actions:
```
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Create feature branch if not already on one: feature/${issue_key}-{description}
3. Push to remote with -u flag
4. Use gh pr create with:
   - Title: "${issue_key}: ${summary}"
   - Body format:
     ## Summary
     - Brief description of changes
     - References Jira issue: ${issue_key}

     ## Acceptance Criteria Met
     - [ ] Criterion 1
     - [ ] Criterion 2

     ## Testing
     - [ ] All tests passing
     - [ ] Coverage meets threshold
     - [ ] Manual testing completed

     ## Related Issues
     - Jira: ${issue_key}

     🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
5. Capture PR URL from output
```

## Step 6: Update Jira Issue (Initial)

Link the PR and post initial update.

### Actions:
```
1. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_add_comment to post:
   "Pull request created: {PR_URL}

   Implementation complete:
   - All acceptance criteria met
   - Tests passing
   - Documentation updated

   Proceeding with QA transition and sub-item documentation..."
```

## Step 7: Document All Sub-Items (MANDATORY)

After PR creation, document implementation details on ALL sub-tasks and linked issues.

### Actions:
```
1. Invoke the `sub-item-documenter` agent with:
   - Parent issue key: ${issue_key}
   - PR URL: {PR_URL}
   - Branch name: {branch_name}

2. The agent will:
   - Fetch all subtasks from the parent issue
   - Fetch all linked issues (blocks, relates to, etc.)
   - For EACH sub-item, post a detailed comment:

   ## Implementation Complete ✅

   **PR:** {PR_URL}
   **Branch:** {branch_name}

   ### Changes Made
   - {specific changes for this sub-item}

   ### Files Modified
   - `path/to/file1.ts`
   - `path/to/file2.ts`

   ### Testing
   - Unit tests: ✅ Passing
   - Integration tests: ✅ Passing
   - Coverage: {X}%

   ### Related Commits
   - {commit_hash}: {message}

   ---
   🤖 Documented by Claude Code Orchestrator

3. Track documentation progress:
   - Log each sub-item documented
   - Handle failures gracefully (continue with others)
   - Report final count
```

## Step 8: Transition ALL Items to QA (MANDATORY)

Transition the main issue AND all sub-items to QA status.

### Actions:
```
1. Invoke the `qa-transition` agent with:
   - Parent issue key: ${issue_key}
   - Include subtasks: true
   - Include linked issues: true

2. The agent will:
   - Find available QA transitions for each issue
   - Handle different QA status names (QA, Ready for QA, In QA, Testing, etc.)
   - Transition the PARENT issue to QA
   - Transition ALL subtasks to QA
   - Transition linked issues to QA (if appropriate)

3. Status Mapping:
   - "QA" (preferred)
   - "Ready for QA"
   - "In QA"
   - "Quality Assurance"
   - "Testing"

4. Handle failures:
   - Log issues that couldn't be transitioned
   - Continue with remaining items
   - Report which transitions failed (may need manual update)

5. Post QA transition comment on parent:
   "🔄 QA Transition Complete

   Main issue: ${issue_key} → QA ✅
   Sub-items transitioned: {count}/{total}

   All items are now ready for quality assurance review."
```

## Step 9: Final Completion Summary

Post final summary and verify all completion criteria.

### Actions:
```
1. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_add_comment on parent issue to post:
   "## 🎉 Development Complete - Ready for QA

   **Pull Request:** {PR_URL}
   **Branch:** {branch_name}

   ### Completion Summary
   | Phase | Status |
   |-------|--------|
   | Explore | ✅ Complete |
   | Plan | ✅ Complete |
   | Code | ✅ Complete |
   | Test | ✅ All Passing ({test_count} tests) |
   | Fix | ✅ No Issues |
   | Document | ✅ Complete |

   ### Sub-Items Status
   | Issue | Documented | QA Status |
   |-------|------------|-----------|
   | {SUBTASK-1} | ✅ | ✅ QA |
   | {SUBTASK-2} | ✅ | ✅ QA |

   ### Test Coverage
   - Coverage: {coverage}%
   - New tests: {new_test_count}

   ### What's Next
   This issue and all sub-items are now in **QA** status.
   Please review the PR and run QA validation.

   🤖 Orchestrated by Claude Code | Total agents: {agent_count}
   ⏱️ Development time: {duration}"

2. Verify completion checklist:
   - [ ] PR created and linked
   - [ ] All sub-items documented
   - [ ] Main issue in QA
   - [ ] All sub-items in QA
   - [ ] Obsidian vault updated
   - [ ] No pending errors
```

## Step 10: Create Review Roadmap (MANDATORY)

Break down the PR into bite-sized review tasks so reviewers can tackle small chunks at a time.

### Actions:
```
1. Invoke the `review-facilitator` agent with:
   - Parent issue key: ${issue_key}
   - PR URL: {PR_URL}
   - All sub-item keys

2. The agent will:
   - Analyze PR complexity and lines changed
   - Group changes into reviewable chunks (5-15 min each)
   - Create a review roadmap on the parent issue

3. Review Roadmap Comment:
   "## 📖 Review Roadmap

   This PR is broken into **X reviewable chunks**.
   Total estimated review time: ~Y minutes

   ### Review Tasks (pick any to start!)
   | # | Sub-Item | Focus | Files | Est. Time | Complexity |
   |---|----------|-------|-------|-----------|------------|
   | 1 | PROJ-201 | Test cases | 3 | 5 min | 🟢 Quick |
   | 2 | PROJ-202 | Component | 4 | 10 min | 🟡 Standard |
   | 3 | PROJ-203 | API layer | 5 | 15 min | 🟡 Standard |
   | 4 | PROJ-204 | Error handling | 2 | 8 min | 🟢 Quick |

   ### How to Review
   1. **Pick any row** - you don't need to go in order!
   2. Open the sub-item to see the review checklist
   3. Review just those files (5-15 min max)
   4. Add comments on the PR or sub-item
   5. ✅ Check off items as you complete them

   **No need to review everything at once!**
   Each sub-item is independently reviewable."

4. Each sub-item already has (from sub-item-documenter):
   - 📋 Review Checklist (5-7 quick items)
   - ⏱️ Estimated review time
   - 🎯 Focus areas with file list
   - 📚 Suggested review order
   - ❓ Specific feedback questions

5. Complexity Categories:
   - 🟢 Quick (< 5 min): Config, small fixes, docs
   - 🟡 Standard (5-15 min): Features, components
   - 🔴 Deep (15-30 min): Architecture, complex logic
```

### Why Bite-Sized Reviews Matter:
```
- Reviewers can contribute in short time blocks
- Each sub-item is independently reviewable
- No need to understand entire PR at once
- Reduces review fatigue and improves quality
- Enables parallel reviews by multiple team members
- Clear progress tracking (X of Y chunks reviewed)
```

## Step 11: Final Documentation Summary (MANDATORY)

Post comprehensive documentation summary to PR and Jira with all Confluence links.

### Actions:
```
1. Invoke `pr-documentation-logger` agent to create final PR comment:

   "## 📚 Complete Documentation Trail

   ### Confluence Documentation Created

   ---
   🤖 Full audit trail maintained by Jira Orchestrator"

2. Post final summary to parent Jira issue:

   "## 📋 Complete Documentation Package

   All documentation has been created and linked:

   **Confluence:**
   - [Technical Design]({url}) - Architecture & specifications
   - [Implementation Notes]({url}) - Code decisions
   - [Test Plan & Results]({url}) - Testing strategy
   - [Runbook]({url}) - Operations guide

   **GitHub:**

   - [PR Documentation Trail]({pr_comment_url}) - Complete audit log

   **Sub-Items:**
   All {count} sub-items have been documented with:
   - Implementation details
   - Review checklists
   - Confluence links

   ---
   Ready for QA review. All documentation is complete."

3. Update each sub-item with Confluence links:
   - Add comment with relevant Confluence page links
   - Reference parent documentation
```

## Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully at each step:

### Invalid Issue Key Format:
```
If issue_key does not match pattern [A-Z]+-[0-9]+:
  Respond: "Invalid issue key format. Expected format: ABC-123 (project key + issue number)"
  Exit without making Jira API calls
```

### Issue Not Found:
```
If mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue returns 404:
  Respond: "Issue ${issue_key} not found. Please verify the issue key and try again."
  Exit
```

### Transition Failures:
```
If status transition fails:
  Log warning
  Continue with orchestration
  Note in final comment that manual status update may be needed
```

### Test Failures:
```
If tests fail in TEST phase:
  Do NOT skip to DOCUMENT
  Execute FIX phase thoroughly
  Re-run TEST phase
  Only proceed when all tests pass
```

### PR Creation Failures:
```
If gh pr create fails:
  Log the error
  Add Jira comment with commit details
  Instruct user to create PR manually
  Provide the commit message and branch name
```

## Context Management

Track context usage throughout orchestration:

### Checkpointing:
```
Create checkpoints after each phase completion
Save checkpoint data to temp files
Post phase summaries as Jira comments for continuity
```

### Context Optimization:
```
If context exceeds 75%:
  Trigger context compression
  Archive phase outputs to Obsidian vault
  Keep only current phase context active
```

## Agent Limits

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Minimum** | 3 agents |
| **Maximum** | 13 agents |
| **Typical Bug** | 5-7 agents |
| **Typical Story** | 7-10 agents |
| **Typical Task** | 4-6 agents |

## Model Assignment

Assign appropriate models based on task complexity:
