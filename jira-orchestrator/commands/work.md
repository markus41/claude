# Jira Issue Orchestration

You are initiating work on a **Jira issue** with full orchestration. This command fetches the issue, creates a comprehensive execution plan, and coordinates sub-agents through all 6 phases.

## Issue Details

**Issue Key:** ${issue_key}

## Step 1: Validate and Fetch Issue

First, validate the issue key format and fetch the issue from Jira.

### Actions:
```
1. Validate issue key matches pattern: [A-Z]+-[0-9]+ (e.g., ABC-123, PROJ-456)
2. If invalid format, respond with error and exit
3. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue with issue_key parameter
4. Extract all relevant fields:
   - summary: Issue title
   - description: Full description
   - issuetype: Bug, Story, Task, Epic, etc.
   - status: Current status
   - priority: Issue priority
   - assignee: Assigned user
   - reporter: Reporter
   - labels: All labels
   - components: Components
   - fixVersions: Target versions
   - customfield_*: Story points, acceptance criteria, etc.
   - subtasks: All subtasks
   - parent: Parent issue if exists
5. If issue not found, respond with error and exit
```

## Step 2: Update Jira Status to "In Progress"

Before starting work, transition the issue to "In Progress".

### Actions:
```
1. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_transition_issue
2. Set status to "In Progress"
3. Add initial comment: "Starting orchestrated development with Claude Code"
```

## Step 3: Create Orchestration Plan

Based on the issue type, create an appropriate orchestration strategy.

### Issue Type Strategies:

#### For Bugs:
```
EXPLORE (2 agents):
  - bug-detective: Reproduce the bug, analyze logs, identify root cause
  - impact-analyst: Assess scope of impact, check for similar issues

PLAN (1 agent):
  - fix-strategist: Design fix approach, minimal changes

CODE (2 agents):
  - bug-fixer: Implement fix
  - regression-tester: Add regression test

  - test-runner: Verify bug is fixed
  - edge-case-validator: Test edge cases

FIX (1 agent):
  - debugger: Address any test failures

DOCUMENT (1 agent):
  - documentation-expert: Update changelog, add root cause to Obsidian vault
```

#### For Stories/Features:
```

  - planner: Create execution plan

CODE (2 agents):
  - implementer: Execute the task
  - validator: Verify implementation

TEST (2 agents):
  - test-runner: Run tests
  - quality-checker: Verify quality standards

FIX (1 agent):
  - fixer: Address issues

DOCUMENT (1 agent):
  - documentation-expert: Update documentation
```

## Step 4: Execute 6-Phase Protocol

Run the mandatory orchestration protocol with the agents defined above.

### Mandatory Protocol:
```
EXPLORE (2+ agents) → PLAN (1-2) → CODE (2-4) → TEST (2-3) → FIX (1-2) → DOCUMENT (1-2)
```

### Phase Execution Guidelines:

#### Phase 1: EXPLORE
```
Spawn appropriate agents based on issue type
Extract all requirements from Jira issue:
  - Description
  - Acceptance criteria
  - Story points
  - Labels and components
  - Related issues and subtasks
Understand codebase context
Identify dependencies and risks
Document findings
```

#### Phase 2: PLAN
```
Create detailed execution plan
Break down into tasks with dependencies
Create task DAG for parallel execution
Assign agents to tasks
Define checkpoints and success criteria
Post plan summary as Jira comment
```

#### Phase 3: CODE
```
Execute implementation tasks in parallel where possible
Write tests alongside code
Commit frequently with clear messages
Reference issue key in commits: "ABC-123: Description"
Handle edge cases and error states
Validate against acceptance criteria continuously
```

#### Phase 4: TEST
```
Run full test suite
Measure code coverage (target 80%+ for new code)
Run security scans if applicable
Validate acceptance criteria from Jira
Document test results
Post test status as Jira comment
```

#### Phase 5: FIX
```
Address all test failures
Fix security vulnerabilities
Address coverage gaps
Optimize performance if needed
Re-run tests after each fix
Verify no regressions
```

#### Phase 6: DOCUMENT
```
Update README and docs
Create ADRs for architectural decisions
Sync documentation to Obsidian vault:
  Path: C:\Users\MarkusAhling\obsidian\Repositories\{org}\{repo}\Issues\${issue_key}.md
Document:
  - Issue summary
  - Solution approach
  - Implementation details
  - Testing results
  - Lessons learned
Prepare final commit message
```

## Step 5: Create Pull Request

Once all phases are complete and tests pass, create a PR.

### Actions:
```
1. Ensure all changes are committed
2. Create feature branch if not already on one: feature/${issue_key}-{description}
3. Push to remote with -u flag
4. Use gh pr create with:
   - Title: "${issue_key}: ${summary}"
   - Body format:
     ## Summary
     - Brief description of changes
     - References Jira issue: ${issue_key}

     ## Acceptance Criteria Met
     - [ ] Criterion 1
     - [ ] Criterion 2

     ## Testing
     - [ ] All tests passing
     - [ ] Coverage meets threshold
     - [ ] Manual testing completed

     ## Related Issues
     - Jira: ${issue_key}

     🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
5. Capture PR URL from output
```

## Step 6: Update Jira Issue (Initial)

Link the PR and post initial update.

### Actions:
```
1. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_add_comment to post:
   "Pull request created: {PR_URL}

   Implementation complete:
   - All acceptance criteria met
   - Tests passing
   - Documentation updated

   Proceeding with QA transition and sub-item documentation..."
```

## Step 7: Document All Sub-Items (MANDATORY)

After PR creation, document implementation details on ALL sub-tasks and linked issues.

### Actions:
```
1. Invoke the `sub-item-documenter` agent with:
   - Parent issue key: ${issue_key}
   - PR URL: {PR_URL}
   - Branch name: {branch_name}

2. The agent will:
   - Fetch all subtasks from the parent issue
   - Fetch all linked issues (blocks, relates to, etc.)
   - For EACH sub-item, post a detailed comment:

   ## Implementation Complete ✅

   **PR:** {PR_URL}
   **Branch:** {branch_name}

   ### Changes Made
   - {specific changes for this sub-item}

   ### Files Modified
   - `path/to/file1.ts`
   - `path/to/file2.ts`

   ### Testing
   - Unit tests: ✅ Passing
   - Integration tests: ✅ Passing
   - Coverage: {X}%

   ### Related Commits
   - {commit_hash}: {message}

   ---
   🤖 Documented by Claude Code Orchestrator

3. Track documentation progress:
   - Log each sub-item documented
   - Handle failures gracefully (continue with others)
   - Report final count
```

## Step 8: Transition ALL Items to QA (MANDATORY)

Transition the main issue AND all sub-items to QA status.

### Actions:
```
1. Invoke the `qa-transition` agent with:
   - Parent issue key: ${issue_key}
   - Include subtasks: true
   - Include linked issues: true

2. The agent will:
   - Find available QA transitions for each issue
   - Handle different QA status names (QA, Ready for QA, In QA, Testing, etc.)
   - Transition the PARENT issue to QA
   - Transition ALL subtasks to QA
   - Transition linked issues to QA (if appropriate)

3. Status Mapping:
   - "QA" (preferred)
   - "Ready for QA"
   - "In QA"
   - "Quality Assurance"
   - "Testing"

4. Handle failures:
   - Log issues that couldn't be transitioned
   - Continue with remaining items
   - Report which transitions failed (may need manual update)

5. Post QA transition comment on parent:
   "🔄 QA Transition Complete

   Main issue: ${issue_key} → QA ✅
   Sub-items transitioned: {count}/{total}

   All items are now ready for quality assurance review."
```

## Step 9: Final Completion Summary

Post final summary and verify all completion criteria.

### Actions:
```
1. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_add_comment on parent issue to post:
   "## 🎉 Development Complete - Ready for QA

   **Pull Request:** {PR_URL}
   **Branch:** {branch_name}

   ### Completion Summary
   | Phase | Status |
   |-------|--------|
   | Explore | ✅ Complete |
   | Plan | ✅ Complete |
   | Code | ✅ Complete |
   | Test | ✅ All Passing ({test_count} tests) |
   | Fix | ✅ No Issues |
   | Document | ✅ Complete |

   ### Sub-Items Status
   | Issue | Documented | QA Status |
   |-------|------------|-----------|
   | {SUBTASK-1} | ✅ | ✅ QA |
   | {SUBTASK-2} | ✅ | ✅ QA |

   ### Test Coverage
   - Coverage: {coverage}%
   - New tests: {new_test_count}

   ### What's Next
   This issue and all sub-items are now in **QA** status.
   Please review the PR and run QA validation.

   ---
   🤖 Orchestrated by Claude Code | Total agents: {agent_count}
   ⏱️ Development time: {duration}"

2. Verify completion checklist:
   - [ ] PR created and linked
   - [ ] All sub-items documented
   - [ ] Main issue in QA
   - [ ] All sub-items in QA
   - [ ] Obsidian vault updated
   - [ ] No pending errors
```

## Error Handling

Handle errors gracefully at each step:

### Invalid Issue Key Format:
```
If issue_key does not match pattern [A-Z]+-[0-9]+:
  Respond: "Invalid issue key format. Expected format: ABC-123 (project key + issue number)"
  Exit without making Jira API calls
```

### Issue Not Found:
```
If mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue returns 404:
  Respond: "Issue ${issue_key} not found. Please verify the issue key and try again."
  Exit
```

### Transition Failures:
```
If status transition fails:
  Log warning
  Continue with orchestration
  Note in final comment that manual status update may be needed
```

### Test Failures:
```
If tests fail in TEST phase:
  Do NOT skip to DOCUMENT
  Execute FIX phase thoroughly
  Re-run TEST phase
  Only proceed when all tests pass
```

### PR Creation Failures:
```
If gh pr create fails:
  Log the error
  Add Jira comment with commit details
  Instruct user to create PR manually
  Provide the commit message and branch name
```

## Context Management

Track context usage throughout orchestration:

### Checkpointing:
```
Create checkpoints after each phase completion
Save checkpoint data to temp files
Post phase summaries as Jira comments for continuity
```

### Context Optimization:
```
If context exceeds 75%:
  Trigger context compression
  Archive phase outputs to Obsidian vault
  Keep only current phase context active
```

## Agent Limits

| Constraint | Value |
|------------|-------|
| **Minimum** | 3 agents |
| **Maximum** | 13 agents |
| **Typical Bug** | 5-7 agents |
| **Typical Story** | 7-10 agents |
| **Typical Task** | 4-6 agents |

## Model Assignment

Assign appropriate models based on task complexity:

| Model | Use For |
|-------|---------|
| **opus-4.5** | Complex architecture decisions, strategic planning (PLAN phase) |
| **sonnet-4.5** | Development, analysis, most CODE phase work |
| **haiku** | Documentation, simple tasks, status updates |

## Success Criteria

Orchestration is complete when:
- [ ] All 6 phases executed successfully (EXPLORE → DOCUMENT)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Documentation updated in both repo and Obsidian vault
- [ ] PR created and linked to Jira
- [ ] **ALL sub-items documented** (implementation comments posted)
- [ ] **Main issue transitioned to QA**
- [ ] **ALL sub-items transitioned to QA**
- [ ] Final completion summary posted
- [ ] No blockers remain

## Example Usage

```bash
# Work on a bug
/jira:work ABC-123

# Work on a story
/jira:work PROJ-456

# Work on a task
/jira:work DEV-789
```

## Integration with Other Commands

This command can be used in conjunction with:
- `/jira:sync` - Sync all issues before starting work
- `/jira:status` - Check orchestration status
- `/orchestration-resume` - Resume if interrupted

## Jira Comment Timeline

Post comments at key milestones:

1. **Start**: "Starting orchestrated development with Claude Code"
2. **After EXPLORE**: "Exploration complete: {key findings}"
3. **After PLAN**: "Execution plan created: {summary}"
