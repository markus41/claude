# Subscription Upgrade Workflow

Handles subscription tier changes for Lobbi tenants, including upgrades, downgrades, and plan modifications with proration and feature management.

## Subscription Change Types

### Type A: Upgrade (Immediate)
**Example:** Basic → Pro, Pro → Enterprise
**Behavior:**
- Immediate feature access
- Proration charged immediately
- Member limits increased
- New features unlocked

### Type B: Downgrade (End of Period)
**Example:** Pro → Basic, Enterprise → Pro
**Behavior:**
- Features remain active until period end
- No refund, credit for next billing
- Member limit enforcement at renewal
- Warning for feature loss

### Type C: Plan Modification (Same Tier)
**Example:** Monthly → Annual, add-on changes
**Behavior:**
- Depends on change type
- Annual switch: immediate with proration
- Add-ons: immediate effect

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: Eligibility Check
**Agent:** subscription-lifecycle-manager
**Tasks:**
1. Verify tenant subscription status (active, not suspended)
2. Check if target plan is available for tenant
3. Validate tenant has permission to change plans
4. Check for pending subscription changes
5. Verify no outstanding payment issues
6. Validate feature compatibility
7. Check member count vs. new plan limits
8. Review custom contract restrictions

**Eligibility Rules:**
- Active subscription (not cancelled or past due)
- No pending disputes or chargebacks
- Member count within new plan limits (or will be reduced)
- No scheduled changes already queued
- Target plan available in tenant's region

**Outputs:**
- Eligibility status (pass/fail/warning)
- Blocking issues (if any)
- Warning messages
- Current subscription details
- Target plan details

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes

### Stage 2: Plan Comparison & Impact Analysis
**Agent:** subscription-lifecycle-manager
**Tasks:**
1. Load current plan features and limits
2. Load target plan features and limits
3. Generate feature comparison matrix
4. Identify features to be added/removed
5. Check member count impact
6. Identify data/usage that exceeds new limits
7. Calculate storage/API call impacts
8. Generate impact summary

**Comparison Matrix:**
```
Feature              | Current | Target  | Change
---------------------|---------|---------|----------
Members              | 50      | 200     | +150
Storage (GB)         | 10      | 100     | +90
Custom branding      | No      | Yes     | Added
API calls/month      | 1,000   | 10,000  | +9,000
SSO                  | No      | Yes     | Added
Priority support     | No      | Yes     | Added
```

**Duration:** 2-3 minutes

### Stage 3: Proration Calculation
**Agent:** billing-calculation-specialist
**Tasks:**

6. Calculate next billing amount
7. Apply any promotional credits
8. Calculate taxes if applicable
9. Generate pricing breakdown

**Proration Logic:**

**Upgrade (Immediate):**
```
Current Plan: $100/month, 15 days used, 15 days remaining
Unused Credit: ($100 / 30) * 15 = $50
Target Plan: $200/month
Prorated Charge: ($200 / 30) * 15 = $100
Amount Due Now: $100 - $50 = $50
Next Billing: $200 (full amount)
```

**Downgrade (End of Period):**
```
Current Plan: $200/month, 10 days used, 20 days remaining
No immediate charge
Current plan continues for 20 days
Next Billing: $100 (new plan amount)
```

**Outputs:**
- Proration breakdown
- Immediate charge amount (if any)
