# Member Enrollment Workflow

Multi-path member enrollment workflow supporting self-registration, admin invitation, and bulk import for the Lobbi platform.

## Enrollment Paths

### Path A: Self-Registration
**Trigger:** User submits registration form
**Stages:** Validation → Duplicate Check → Keycloak Creation → Member Record → Welcome Email

### Path B: Admin Invitation
**Trigger:** Tenant admin invites user
**Stages:** Validation → Duplicate Check → Invitation Email → Keycloak Creation (on accept) → Member Record

### Path C: Bulk Import
**Trigger:** CSV/Excel upload by admin
**Stages:** File Validation → Batch Processing → Individual Enrollment (Path B for each)

## Workflow Stages

**Agent:** membership-specialist
**Tasks:**
1. Identify enrollment source (form, invitation, bulk)
2. Validate tenant context and permissions
3. Check tenant member quota/limits
4. Route to appropriate enrollment path
5. Initialize audit trail

**Outputs:**
- Selected enrollment path
- Tenant context
- Permission validation
- Quota check result

**Duration:** <1 minute

### Stage 1: Data Validation
**Agent:** data-validation-specialist
**Tasks:**
1. Validate required fields (email, name, role)
2. Check email format and domain rules
3. Validate phone number if provided

**Outputs:**
- Validation result (pass/fail)

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

### Stage 2: Duplicate Check
**Agent:** membership-specialist
**Tasks:**
1. Check if email exists in tenant member database
2. Check if email exists in Keycloak realm
3. Handle duplicate scenarios:
   - Existing active member: reject or update
   - Existing inactive member: reactivate option
   - Pending invitation: resend or update
4. Check for similar names (fuzzy matching)
5. Validate against exclusion lists

**Duplicate Handling:**
- **Active Member:** Return error, suggest login
- **Inactive Member:** Offer reactivation
- **Pending Invitation:** Offer to resend
- **Different Tenant:** Allow (multi-tenant support)

**Outputs:**
- Duplicate check result
- Existing member ID (if duplicate)
- Recommended action

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

### Stage 3: Keycloak User Creation

4. Configure authentication requirements
5. Set email verification requirement
6. Generate temporary password (if admin-created)

**Duration:** 1-2 minutes

### Stage 6: Bulk Processing (Conditional)
**Agent:** bulk-import-processor
**Tasks:**

2. Validate file format and headers
3. Process rows in batches (e.g., 50 at a time)
4. For each row, execute stages 1-5
5. Track success/failure for each row
6. Generate import summary report
7. Send completion email to admin
8. Handle partial failures gracefully

**Batch Processing:**
- Process in chunks to avoid timeouts
- Parallel processing where possible
- Transaction management for data integrity
- Detailed error logging

**Outputs:**
- Import summary (total, success, failed)
- Error report with row numbers
- Successfully enrolled member list
- Failed member list with reasons

**Duration:** 30-90 minutes (depends on volume)
