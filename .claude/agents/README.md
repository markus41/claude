# Agent System

The agent system provides 137 specialized subagents that Claude invokes using the
`Task` tool. Each agent is a markdown file with a YAML frontmatter block (or embedded
YAML section) that declares its name, model, tools, and purpose. Agents are organized
into domain-specific directories so they are easy to find and extend.

## Why agents instead of one general assistant

A single general-purpose assistant accumulates context and loses precision on
specialized tasks. Agents isolate concerns: a `k8s-debugger` knows Kubernetes
deeply and nothing else, which keeps its instructions tight and its output reliable.
The master orchestrators (angelos-symbo, ultrathink) handle decomposition and
delegation — specialized agents handle execution.

## Agent file format

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: One-line description. Tells Claude when to invoke this agent.
tools: Read, Grep, Glob, Bash, Write, Edit
model: sonnet
memory: project
---

You are a [role]. [System prompt defining behavior, checklist, output format...]
```

Some agents use an embedded YAML block instead of frontmatter:

```markdown
# Agent Title

## Agent Metadata
\`\`\`yaml
name: agent-name
model: opus
category: orchestration
keywords:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
\`\`\`
```

The `description` field (or the keywords list) is what Claude reads to decide
whether to invoke this agent. Write descriptions as "use this when..." phrases.

## Top-level core agents (8)

These eight agents live directly in `agents/` and are the most broadly applicable.
They are proactively invoked across all domains.

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `code-reviewer` | sonnet | Post-write code review: security, type safety, error handling, N+1 queries |
| `debugger` | sonnet | Systematic debugging: reproduce, isolate, fix, regression-test |
| `doc-writer` | haiku | Documentation for code, APIs, and architecture |
| `docker-ops` | haiku | Docker build, push, compose, multi-stage image management |
| `k8s-image-auditor` | sonnet | Audits K8s deployments for stale images and pull policy misconfigurations |
| `researcher` | haiku | Fast lookup and web research via MCP tools |
| `security-reviewer` | sonnet | Security audit: injection, secrets exposure, auth flaws, dependency CVEs |
| `test-writer` | sonnet | Test generation: unit, integration, edge cases, regression tests |

## Key agents spotlight

**`orchestration/ultrathink`** (model: opus) — Extended reasoning agent for problems
that need deep deliberation. Invoked when you use keywords like `ultrathink`,
`think harder`, or `analyze deeply`. Uses Claude's extended thinking API with
configurable token budgets. Ideal for architecture decisions, security threat modeling,
and multi-system analysis.

**`orchestration/angelos-symbo`** (model: opus) — Master orchestrator. Designs and
coordinates complex multi-agent workflows. Handles task decomposition, parallel
execution planning, context flow between agents, and graceful degradation when
sub-agents fail. The recommended starting point for any task requiring 3+ agents.

**`orchestration/feature-dev`** (model: sonnet) — Full-stack TDD agent. Implements
features end-to-end following the EXPLORE → PLAN → CODE → TEST → FIX → DOCUMENT
protocol. Writes tests before implementation and does not consider a feature complete
until all tests pass and documentation is updated.

## Adding a new agent

1. Create `agents/<category>/<name>.md`
2. Add YAML frontmatter with `name`, `description`, `tools`, and `model`
3. Write a focused system prompt — one responsibility, clear output format
4. Keep the description field precise: it controls when Claude chooses this agent

Do not duplicate responsibilities across agents. If an agent would mostly repeat
an existing one, extend the existing agent's system prompt instead.
