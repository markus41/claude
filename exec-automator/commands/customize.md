**Default Configuration:**
```yaml

  business_impact:
    weight: 0.35
    factors:
      - revenue_potential: 0.4
      - strategic_alignment: 0.3
      - competitive_advantage: 0.2
      - market_timing: 0.1

  urgency:
    weight: 0.25
    factors:
      - deadline_proximity: 0.4
      - stakeholder_pressure: 0.3
      - dependency_blocking: 0.2
      - regulatory_compliance: 0.1

  feasibility:
    weight: 0.20
    factors:
      - technical_complexity: 0.3
      - resource_availability: 0.3
      - risk_level: 0.2
      - cost_effectiveness: 0.2

  strategic_fit:
    weight: 0.20
    factors:
      - vision_alignment: 0.4
      - capability_building: 0.3
      - innovation_potential: 0.2
      - stakeholder_buy_in: 0.1
```

**Customization Options:**

- Adjust primary category weights (must sum to 1.0)
- Modify factor weights within categories
- Add custom scoring factors
- Define industry-specific criteria
- Set minimum threshold scores
- Configure multi-stage scoring gates

### Decision Confidence Thresholds

```yaml
confidence_thresholds:
  auto_approve: 0.90      # Decisions above this are auto-approved
  recommend: 0.75         # Confident recommendation
  escalate: 0.60          # Needs human review
  reject: 0.40            # Auto-reject below this

  risk_adjusted:
    high_risk_decision: 0.95
    medium_risk_decision: 0.85
    low_risk_decision: 0.75
```

### ROI Calculation Models

```yaml
roi_models:
  standard:
    formula: (benefit - cost) / cost
    time_horizon: 12_months
    discount_rate: 0.10

  strategic:
    formula: weighted_benefit / total_cost
    intangible_weight: 0.30
    time_horizon: 36_months

  innovation:
    formula: (market_potential + learning_value) / investment
    risk_adjustment: 0.20
```

```

---

## Interactive Customization Mode

When running with `interactive=true`, the command will guide you through:

1. **Assessment** - Review current configuration
2. **Recommendations** - AI-suggested optimizations based on usage patterns
3. **Step-by-Step Editing** - Guided modification of settings
4. **Validation** - Check configuration consistency
5. **Testing** - Dry-run with new settings
6. **Rollout** - Gradual deployment with rollback capability

**Interactive Session Example:**
```
> /exec:customize target=scoring interactive=true

Analyzing current scoring configuration...
Current weights: Impact (35%), Urgency (25%), Feasibility (20%), Strategic (20%)

Based on your decision history, I notice:
- Strategic alignment appears underweighted (80% of escalations cite strategic concerns)
- Urgency may be overweighted (only 15% of urgent items deliver expected value)

Recommended adjustments:
1. Increase strategic_fit weight from 20% to 30%
2. Decrease urgency weight from 25% to 20%
3. Add "organizational_readiness" factor to feasibility

[1] Apply recommended changes
[2] Customize manually
[3] See detailed analysis
[4] Cancel

## Customization Best Practices

**Brookside BI Recommendations:**

1. **Start Conservative** - Make incremental adjustments rather than wholesale changes
2. **Monitor Impact** - Track decision quality metrics before and after customization
3. **Document Rationale** - Record why you made specific configuration choices
4. **Version Control** - Keep configuration history for rollback capability
5. **Test in Sandbox** - Validate changes in non-production environment first
6. **Gradual Rollout** - Apply to subset of workflows before full deployment
7. **Stakeholder Alignment** - Ensure customizations reflect organizational consensus
8. **Regular Review** - Revisit configurations quarterly as business evolves

---

## Configuration Validation

All customizations are automatically validated for:

- Mathematical consistency (weights sum to 1.0)
- Logical coherence (no conflicting rules)
- Performance impact (simulation testing)
- Security implications (privilege escalation checks)
- Compliance requirements (audit trail maintenance)

**Validation Output Example:**
```
Validating scoring configuration...
✓ All weights sum to 1.0
✓ No circular dependencies detected
✓ Performance impact: <2% overhead
⚠ Warning: Lowering auto_approve threshold increases manual review volume by ~15%
✓ Audit trail configured correctly
✓ RBAC permissions validated

Configuration is valid and ready to apply.
Estimated impact: 147 decisions/month will change classification
Rollback plan: Automatic if error rate exceeds 5% in first 24 hours
```

---

## Advanced Customization

### Custom Scoring Functions

Define Python-based scoring functions for complex logic:

```python
def custom_strategic_score(decision_data: dict) -> float:
    """
    Custom strategic scoring that considers market timing
    and competitive positioning with exponential weighting
    for time-sensitive opportunities.
    """
    base_score = decision_data.get('strategic_alignment', 0.5)
    market_timing = decision_data.get('market_timing_factor', 0.5)
    competitive_advantage = decision_data.get('competitive_advantage', 0.5)

    # Exponential boost for time-sensitive strategic opportunities
    if market_timing > 0.8 and competitive_advantage > 0.7:
        return min(1.0, base_score * 1.5)

    return (base_score * 0.5) + (market_timing * 0.3) + (competitive_advantage * 0.2)
```

### Machine Learning Integration

Enable continuous learning from decision outcomes:

```yaml
ml_configuration:
  enabled: true
  model_type: gradient_boosted_trees

  training_data:
    source: decision_history
    minimum_samples: 1000
    features:
      - all_scoring_factors
      - contextual_metadata
      - stakeholder_feedback
    target: decision_success_score

  retraining:
    frequency: monthly
    validation_split: 0.2
    performance_threshold: 0.85

  deployment:
    shadow_mode_duration: 2_weeks
    cutover_threshold: 0.90_confidence
    rollback_triggers:
      - accuracy_drop > 5%
      - escalation_rate_increase > 20%
```
