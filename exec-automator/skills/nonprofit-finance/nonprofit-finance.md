# Nonprofit Finance & Accounting Expertise

This skill provides comprehensive knowledge of nonprofit financial management, fund accounting principles, grant compliance, 990 tax form preparation, budgeting, financial controls, audit preparation, insurance and risk management, and automation patterns tailored for nonprofit organizations and associations.

## Core Competencies

### 1. Fund Accounting Principles

**Fund Accounting Fundamentals:**

Nonprofit fund accounting differs from for-profit accounting by tracking resources based on donor restrictions rather than only organizational departments.

**Net Asset Classifications (FASB ASC 958):**

1. **Net Assets Without Donor Restrictions**
   - Unrestricted funds available for general operations
   - Board-designated funds (internally restricted)
   - Operating reserves
   - Quasi-endowments
   - Property and equipment

2. **Net Assets With Donor Restrictions**
   - **Purpose Restrictions:** Funds designated for specific programs or projects
   - **Time Restrictions:** Funds available only after specific date or event
   - **Perpetual Restrictions:** Endowments where principal must be maintained

**Release of Restrictions:**
- Record when purpose or time restriction is satisfied
- Transfer from "with donor restrictions" to "without donor restrictions"
- Document in grant tracking systems
- Report releases in Statement of Activities

**Fund Accounting Best Practices:**

2. Not substantially related to exempt purpose
3. Generates more than $1,000 annually

**Common UBIT Triggers:**

- Sale of merchandise unrelated to mission
- Services provided to non-members
- Facility rentals to for-profit entities

**UBIT Exceptions and Safe Harbors:**
- Volunteer-run activities
- Donated goods sales
- Qualified sponsorships (corporate name/logo only)
- Activities for members, patients, students, officers
- Convention/trade show income (for 501(c)(6))
- Rental income from real property (if not debt-financed)
- Income from passive investments

**Form 990-T Filing:**
Required if gross UBIT exceeds $1,000
Due on 15th day of 5th month after year-end
Estimate tax payments may be required

**Dues Revenue Management:**

**Membership Dues Accounting:**

```
MEMBERSHIP DUES CLASSIFICATION

Tax Treatment Analysis:
1. Determine if dues are deductible to member:
   - 501(c)(3): Generally deductible as charitable contribution
   - 501(c)(6): Generally NOT deductible (business expense only)
   - Exception: Must disclose non-deductible lobbying portion

2. Revenue Recognition:
   Recognize over membership period (12 months typical)

Journal Entries:
Upon receipt:
DR: Cash                           $1,200
    CR: Deferred Revenue (Dues)            $1,200

Monthly recognition (1/12):
DR: Deferred Revenue               $100
    CR: Membership Dues Revenue            $100

3. Lobbying Disclosure (501(c)(6)):
If dues include lobbying costs, must notify members:

Example Notice:
"The portion of your membership dues allocated to lobbying
activities is 15% ($75 of your $500 dues). This amount is
not deductible as a business expense under IRC Section 162(e)."
```

**Dues Structure Options:**

```
MEMBERSHIP TIER PRICING

Tier 1: Individual Professional ($250/year)
- Deferred monthly: $20.83/month

Tier 2: Small Business (1-10 employees) ($1,000/year)
- Deferred monthly: $83.33/month

Tier 3: Corporate (11-50 employees) ($5,000/year)
- Deferred monthly: $416.67/month

Multi-Year Discount:
2-year prepayment: 10% discount
3-year prepayment: 15% discount

Accounting Treatment:
DR: Cash                           $2,700
    CR: Deferred Revenue - Year 1          $1,275
    CR: Deferred Revenue - Year 2          $1,275
    CR: Discount Revenue (contra)          ($150)
```

**Lobbying Compliance (501(c)(3) with 501(h) election):**

**Expenditure Test Limits:**

```
LOBBYING EXPENDITURE LIMITS (501(h) ELECTION)

Exempt Purpose Expenditures | Lobbying Limit | Grassroots Limit
≤ $500,000                  | 20% ($100K max) | 5% ($25K max)
$500K - $1M                 | $100K + 15%     | $25K + 3.75%
$1M - $1.5M                 | $175K + 10%     | $43.75K + 2.5%
$1.5M - $17M                | $225K + 5%      | $56.25K + 1.25%
> $17M                      | $1M max         | $250K max

Tracking Requirements:
- Separate account codes for lobbying expenses
- Time tracking for lobbying activities
- Volunteer time allocation
- Reporting on Schedule C of Form 990

Example Calculation:
Exempt Purpose Expenditures: $1,200,000
Lobbying Limit: $175,000 + [($1,200,000 - $1,000,000) × 10%]
              = $175,000 + $20,000 = $195,000
Grassroots Limit: $195,000 × 25% = $48,750

Actual Lobbying Expenses: $150,000 (within limit)
Grassroots Lobbying: $40,000 (within limit)
Status: Compliant
```

### 9. Revenue Recognition

**Contribution Revenue (ASC 958):**

**Key Principles:**
- Recognize when contribution is unconditional
- Conditional contributions recognized when barrier overcome
- Distinguish between contributions and exchange transactions

**Unconditional vs. Conditional Contributions:**

**Unconditional Contribution:**
- Donor has no right of return
- No barrier to organization's entitlement
- Recognize immediately as revenue

**Conditional Contribution:**
- Contains a barrier (performance requirement)
- Right of return or release from obligation
- Recognize when condition substantially met

**Examples:**

```
CONDITIONAL:
"$50,000 granted upon completion of community health assessment"
→ Revenue recognized when assessment completed

UNCONDITIONAL WITH PURPOSE RESTRICTION:
"$50,000 to support youth programming"
→ Revenue recognized immediately (restricted)
→ Released from restriction when spent on youth programs

CONDITIONAL WITH MEASURABLE OUTCOME:
"$100,000 upon serving 500 families"
→ Refundable if target not met
→ Revenue recognized when 500 families served
```

**Pledge Recognition:**

```
PLEDGE RECEIVABLE AND REVENUE

Year 1 Pledge:
DR: Pledges Receivable - Current      $10,000

```

**In-Kind Contributions:**

```
AP AUTOMATION WORKFLOW

Stage 1: Invoice Receipt
→ Email invoices to ap@organization.org
→ OCR extracts: Vendor, Amount, Due Date, GL Account
→ System creates draft AP entry
→ Flags duplicates or unusual amounts

Stage 2: Approval Routing
IF amount < $1,000:
  → Auto-approve if budgeted
  → Email notification to bookkeeper
ELSE IF amount < $5,000:
  → Route to department manager for approval
  → Email with invoice PDF attached
ELSE:
  → Route to Executive Director for approval
  → Require budget justification

Stage 3: Payment Processing
→ Approved invoices added to payment batch
→ Weekly payment run (every Friday)
→ Generate checks or ACH payments
→ Email remittance advice to vendors
→ Update accounting system
→ Archive invoice PDFs

Stage 4: Exception Handling
→ Missing PO number: Flag for review
→ Over budget: Alert finance committee
→ Duplicate invoice: Hold for verification
→ Vendor not in system: Request W-9 form

Automation Tools:
- Bill.com, Expensify, or QuickBooks Bill Pay
- OCR: ABBYY, Rossum, or native platform
