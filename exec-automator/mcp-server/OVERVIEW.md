## Workflow Execution Flow

### Example: Document Analysis

```
1. User calls analyze_document tool
   ↓
2. MCP server receives request
   ↓
3. Create org analysis workflow (StateGraph)
   ↓
4. Execute workflow with initial state
   ├─ Parse document (PDF/DOCX/TXT)
   ├─ Extract responsibilities (LLM)
   ├─ Categorize responsibilities (LLM)
   ├─ Identify org type (LLM)
   ├─ Score automation potential (Algorithm)
   └─ Generate organizational profile
   ↓
5. Save checkpoint to SQLite + JSON
   ↓
6. Return analysis_id and summary
```

### Example: Workflow Execution with Human Approval

```
1. User calls execute_workflow tool
   ↓
2. Load workflow specification
   ↓
3. Execute StateGraph with checkpointing
   ├─ Node 1: Gather data
   ├─ Node 2: Generate report draft
   ├─ Node 3: Human review (INTERRUPT)
   ↓
4. Workflow pauses, waits for approval
   ↓
5. User calls approve_step tool
   ↓
6. Workflow resumes from checkpoint
   ├─ Node 4: Finalize report
   └─ Node 5: Distribute report
   ↓
7. Return completed status and results
```

## Automation Scoring Algorithm

**Factors Considered (12+):**

**Positive (increase score):**
- Repetitive frequency (daily/weekly)
- Rule-based nature
- Data-driven requirements
- Well-documented processes
- Low stakeholder interaction
- Technology-enabled
- Template-based

**Negative (decrease score):**
- Requires human judgment
- Relationship-intensive
- Creative/strategic requirements
- High-stakes decisions
- Complex stakeholder management
- Regulatory/compliance requirements

**Score to Approach Mapping:**
- 80-100: Full Automation (5-10% human involvement)
- 60-79: Human-in-Loop (20-30% human involvement)
- 40-59: AI-Assisted (50-60% human involvement)
- 20-39: Light AI Support (70-80% human involvement)
- 0-19: Human-Only (95-100% human involvement)
