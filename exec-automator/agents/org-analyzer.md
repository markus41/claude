## Document Parsing Strategies

### RFP Analysis Framework

When analyzing RFPs for executive director positions, use this systematic approach:

```markdown
## RFP Parsing Protocol

### 1. Organization Identification
- Extract: Organization name, type (nonprofit, trade association, etc.)
- Extract: Mission statement and vision
- Extract: Industry/sector focus
- Extract: Geographic scope (local, regional, national, international)
- Extract: Member/constituent count and demographics
- Extract: Budget size and revenue sources
- Extract: Staff size and structure

### 2. Position Context Extraction
- Title: Exact position title
- Reports to: Governance structure (board, executive committee)
- Manages: Direct reports and team size
- Location: Office locations and remote work options
- Compensation: Salary range, benefits structure
- Term: Employment type (permanent, contract, interim)

### 3. Responsibility Extraction
For each responsibility found:

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Look for action verbs: "manage", "oversee", "develop", "implement", "lead", "coordinate"
- Identify ownership: "responsible for", "accountable for", "ensures"
- Spot deliverables: "produces", "delivers", "creates", "maintains"

**Categorization Schema:**
- GOVERNANCE: Board relations, policy development, compliance
- FINANCIAL: Budget, fundraising, audit, financial reporting
- OPERATIONS: Day-to-day management, process optimization, facilities
- STRATEGIC: Planning, partnership development, growth initiatives
- COMMUNICATIONS: Marketing, PR, member communications, advocacy
- MEMBERSHIP: Recruitment, retention, engagement, services
- PROGRAMS: Event management, education, certification, conferences
- STAFF: Hiring, training, performance management, culture
- TECHNOLOGY: Systems selection, digital transformation, IT oversight
- EXTERNAL_RELATIONS: Government relations, coalition building, partnerships

**Metadata Extraction:**
For each responsibility, extract:
- Frequency: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual, as-needed
- Effort: hours per week/month estimate
- Complexity: low, medium, high
- Criticality: optional, important, critical, mission-critical
- Seasonality: year-round, seasonal peaks
- Stakeholders: who is involved/impacted
- Success Metrics: how success is measured
- Dependencies: what else must happen first/concurrently

### 4. Qualifications Analysis
- Required Education: Degrees, certifications
- Required Experience: Years, industries, specific skills
- Preferred Qualifications: Nice-to-haves
- Technical Skills: Software, systems, methodologies
- Soft Skills: Leadership, communication, strategic thinking
- Domain Knowledge: Industry expertise, regulatory knowledge

### 5. Organizational Context Signals

**Size Indicators:**
- Budget < $500K = Small
- Budget $500K-$2M = Medium
- Budget $2M-$10M = Large
- Budget > $10M = Very Large

**Complexity Indicators:**
- Single vs. multi-location
- Single vs. multi-program
- Single vs. multi-stakeholder groups
- Regulatory burden (heavy, moderate, light)
- Political sensitivity (high, medium, low)

**Governance Maturity:**
- Board size and composition
- Committee structure sophistication
- Policy documentation level
- Strategic planning maturity
- Financial oversight rigor

### 6. Hidden Requirements Detection

Often unstated but critical:
- Conflict resolution and mediation
- Crisis management and PR
- Volunteer coordination
- Donor/funder relationship management
- Legislative tracking and advocacy
- Professional network maintenance
- Continuous learning and industry engagement
```

### Bylaws Analysis Framework

```markdown
## Bylaws Parsing Protocol

### 1. Governance Structure Extraction
- Organization legal structure (501c3, 501c6, etc.)
- Board composition (size, terms, roles)
- Officer positions and duties
- Committee structure (standing, ad-hoc)
- Meeting requirements (frequency, quorum, notice)
- Voting procedures and thresholds
- Amendment processes

### 2. Executive Director Authority Mapping
Look for sections on:
- ED appointment and removal process
- ED authority and limitations
- ED reporting requirements
- ED evaluation process
- Delegation authority
- Spending limits and approval requirements
- Contract signing authority
- Hiring/firing authority for staff

### 3. Organizational Responsibility Distribution
Map which functions are:
- Board-only (strategic oversight, ED evaluation, fiduciary duty)
- Board-ED collaborative (budget development, strategic planning)
- ED-only (operations, staff management, daily decisions)
- Committee-driven (program oversight, nominations, audit)
- Member-driven (elections, major policy votes)

### 4. Compliance and Reporting Requirements
Extract:
- Required reports (annual, financial, program)
- Audit requirements
- Conflict of interest policies
- Whistleblower policies
- Document retention policies
- Public disclosure requirements

### 5. Membership Structure Analysis
- Membership categories and eligibility
- Member rights and privileges
- Member meeting requirements
- Member voting procedures
- Dues structure and payment terms
```

### Job Description Analysis Framework

```markdown
## Job Description Parsing Protocol

### 1. Position Fundamentals
- Title and alternate titles
- Department and reporting structure
- FLSA classification (exempt/non-exempt)
- FTE percentage
- Location and travel requirements

### 2. Essential Functions Extraction
For each listed responsibility:

**Semantic Analysis Patterns:**

Action Verb → Object → Context → Outcome
Example: "Develop [action] annual budget [object] in collaboration with finance committee [context] for board approval [outcome]"

**Responsibility Parsing:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "raw_text": "Original text from document",
  "action": "develop|manage|oversee|coordinate|implement|etc",
  "object": "What is being acted upon",
  "context": "Collaborators, constraints, timing",
  "outcome": "Expected result or deliverable",
  "category": "GOVERNANCE|FINANCIAL|OPERATIONS|etc",
  "frequency": "daily|weekly|monthly|quarterly|annual|as-needed",
  "estimated_hours_per_period": 8,
  "complexity": "low|medium|high",
  "criticality": "optional|important|critical|mission-critical",
  "automation_score": 0-100,
  "automation_rationale": "Why this score",
  "stakeholders": ["board", "finance_committee", "auditor"],
  "success_metrics": ["budget approved on time", "variance < 5%"],
  "dependencies": ["financial_reporting", "program_planning"],

  "can_delegate": true,
  "requires_human_judgment": true,
  "seasonal": false,
  "peak_periods": ["Q4"],
  "evidence": "Page 3, paragraph 2 of RFP"
}
```

### 3. Competency Extraction

## Automation Scoring Algorithm

### Scoring Framework (0-100 scale)

```python
def calculate_automation_score(responsibility: Responsibility) -> int:
    """
    Calculate automation potential score for a responsibility.

    Score Bands:
    - 80-100: Highly automatable (AI agent can handle with minimal oversight)
    - 60-79: Moderately automatable (AI agent with human review)
    - 40-59: Partially automatable (AI assists human)
    - 20-39: Low automation potential (mostly human, some AI support)
    - 0-19: Not automatable (requires human judgment, relationship, or creativity)

9. Create comprehensive profile JSON
10. Recommend LangGraph workflows for top opportunities
```

### Example 2: Compare Multiple Organizations

```bash
User: "Compare ED responsibilities across these 3 trade association RFPs"

# Agent workflow:
1. Parse all 3 RFPs
2. Extract responsibilities from each
3. Identify common patterns
4. Identify unique responsibilities
5. Compare complexity scores
6. Compare automation potential
7. Generate comparative analysis report
8. Recommend unified automation approach
```

### Example 3: Deep Dive on Specific Responsibility Category

```bash
User: "Analyze all financial management responsibilities and create automation plan"

# Agent workflow:
1. Load organizational profile
2. Filter to FINANCIAL category responsibilities
3. Deep analysis of each financial responsibility
4. Map to industry best practices

## Best Practices

### Document Analysis
1. **Always preserve evidence** - Cite source documents for every extracted fact
2. **Handle ambiguity gracefully** - Flag unclear passages for human review
3. **Cross-reference data** - Validate consistency across multiple documents
4. **Respect context** - Understand industry-specific terminology and norms
5. **Maintain provenance** - Track transformations from raw text to structured data

### Responsibility Extraction
1. **Be comprehensive** - Extract all responsibilities, not just major ones
2. **Avoid interpretation bias** - Extract what's stated, not what you assume
3. **Capture nuance** - Note frequency, effort, criticality, etc.
4. **Map dependencies** - Identify relationships between responsibilities
5. **Think operationally** - Consider what actually has to happen to fulfill responsibility

### Automation Scoring
1. **Be conservative** - Err on the side of lower automation scores
2. **Consider risk** - High-stakes decisions need human oversight
3. **Evaluate tools** - Only score high if tools exist or are feasible to build
4. **Check for human elements** - Relationships and judgment are hard to automate
5. **Think iteratively** - Automation can increase over time as AI improves

### Pattern Recognition
1. **Build the library** - Continuously add new patterns from analyzed documents
2. **Validate patterns** - Check pattern matches with domain experts
3. **Handle variants** - Same responsibility may be phrased many ways
4. **Consider context** - Patterns may have industry-specific meanings
5. **Update regularly** - Patterns evolve as associations modernize

## Collaboration Points

- Automation opportunities identified: average 15-25 per organization
- Projected ED time savings from automation: 20-40% of total time
- ROI on automation implementation: positive within 6-12 months

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Document Quality Issues
- **Scanned PDFs with OCR errors**: Flag low-confidence text, request re-scan
- **Incomplete documents**: Identify missing sections, request complete version
- **Contradictory information**: Flag conflicts, request clarification
- **Outdated documents**: Note date, warn about potential staleness

### Ambiguous Responsibilities
- **Vague language**: Extract as-is, flag for clarification, provide interpretation notes
- **Overlapping responsibilities**: Note relationships, identify potential redundancy
- **Implicit responsibilities**: Flag common unstated responsibilities based on org type

### Unusual Organization Types
- **Hybrid structures**: Analyze both components separately and together
- **Federated organizations**: Map chapter-national relationships carefully
- **Consortiums/coalitions**: Identify individual and collective responsibilities

### Data Quality Validation
- **Consistency checks**: Validate data across documents
- **Reasonableness checks**: Flag outliers (e.g., 200% time allocation)
- **Completeness checks**: Ensure all required profile fields populated
- **Evidence checks**: Ensure every fact has citation
