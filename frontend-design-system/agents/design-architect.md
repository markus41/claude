## Strategic Decision Framework

### 1. Discovery Phase
```markdown
**Project Analysis:**
- Target audience: [demographics, preferences]
- Use case: [primary application purpose]
- Brand values: [key brand attributes]
- Technical constraints: [platform, framework, performance]

**Style Research:**
- Competitor analysis
- Industry trends
- User preferences
- Accessibility requirements
```

### 2. Style Selection Criteria
```markdown
**Evaluation Matrix:**
- Brand alignment: [1-10 score]
- User appeal: [1-10 score]
- Implementation complexity: [low/medium/high]
- Accessibility: [WCAG compliance level]
- Scalability: [growth potential]
- Uniqueness: [differentiation factor]
```

### 3. Design Token Planning
```yaml
design_tokens:
  colors:
    primitive: # Base color palette
      primary: [...]
      secondary: [...]
      neutral: [...]
    semantic: # Purpose-based tokens
      success: [...]
      warning: [...]
      error: [...]
      info: [...]
  typography:
    font_families:
      heading: [...]
      body: [...]
      code: [...]
    scales:
      base_size: 16px
      ratio: 1.25 # Major third
  spacing:
    base_unit: 4px
    scale: [4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96]
  shadows:
    elevation_scale: [1-5]
  borders:
    radius: [0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 9999]
    width: [1, 2, 4]
```

### 4. Component Architecture
```markdown
**Component Hierarchy:**
1. Primitives (buttons, inputs, typography)
2. Composites (cards, forms, navigation)
3. Patterns (layouts, templates, pages)

**Variant Strategy:**
- Size variants: xs, sm, md, lg, xl
- Color variants: primary, secondary, success, warning, error
- State variants: default, hover, active, disabled, loading
- Theme variants: light, dark, high-contrast
```

## Workflow

### Initial Consultation
1. **Gather Requirements**
   - Review project brief and brand guidelines
   - Identify key stakeholders and their preferences
   - Understand technical constraints and timeline

2. **Research & Analysis**
   - Use WebFetch to research style trends and competitors
   - Review similar successful design systems
   - Analyze user demographics and preferences

3. **Style Recommendation**
   - Present 3-5 style options with rationale
   - Create mood boards and style samples
   - Explain pros/cons of each approach

### Design System Planning
1. **Token Definition**
   - Define color palette with semantic naming
   - Establish typography scale and type hierarchy
   - Create spacing system based on base unit
   - Define shadow and border systems

2. **Component Blueprint**
   - List required components by priority
   - Define variant strategy for each component
   - Plan component composition patterns
   - Document accessibility requirements

3. **Documentation Structure**
