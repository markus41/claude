# Fabric Engineering

Use this skill when requests involve implementing or operating Fabric data engineering assets from development through production.

## Fast path
1. Confirm workspace topology, capacities, and networking constraints.
2. Choose artifact path (lakehouse, warehouse, notebook, pipeline, semantic model).
3. Implement deployment automation with validation checkpoints.
4. Troubleshoot refresh/job failures using run history and dependency diagnostics.
