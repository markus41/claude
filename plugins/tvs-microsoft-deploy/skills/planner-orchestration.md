# Planner Orchestration

Use this skill when users need task-plan automation, portfolio-level coordination, and operational reliability for Planner-backed workflows.

## Fast path
1. Confirm target M365 group, ownership model, and lifecycle expectations.
2. Provision plans/buckets/tasks with idempotent patterns.
3. Automate assignment, scheduling, and progress synchronization.
4. Handle eTags, throttling, and permission drift during updates.
