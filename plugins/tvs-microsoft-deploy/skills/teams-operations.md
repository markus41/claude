# Teams Operations

Use this skill when users need to deploy, govern, or troubleshoot Teams at scale across collaboration, calling, and app surfaces.

## Fast path
1. Classify request (provisioning, policy, compliance, incident, migration).
2. Validate team/channel model and associated M365 group dependencies.
3. Execute lifecycle change with policy and app governance checks.
4. Triage operational issues across membership, messaging, meetings, and app install paths.
