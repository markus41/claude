# SharePoint Governance

Use this skill when requests involve SharePoint standards, compliance controls, access governance, or tenant-wide operational policy.

## Fast path
1. Determine governance objective (provision, secure, retain, audit, decommission).
2. Map site model, hub strategy, and ownership/accountability.
3. Apply permissions, sensitivity, retention, and sharing policies.
4. Investigate drift and remediate inheritance, external sharing, or policy conflicts.
