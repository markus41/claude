# Power Platform ALM

Use this skill when users need to build, package, migrate, or release Power Platform assets with repeatable governance.

## Fast path
1. Classify request as build, migrate, hotfix, or rollback.
2. Validate environment topology, solution segmentation, and connection references.
3. Run pipeline-safe export/import with checks.
4. Resolve import failures via dependency, privilege, and component diagnostics.
