# Excel Enterprise Automation

Use this skill when users need repeatable Excel automation across Graph, Office Scripts, Power Automate, and enterprise integration pipelines.

## Fast path
1. Confirm workbook location, ownership, and concurrency model.
2. Choose execution path (Graph workbook API, Office Script, Power Automate).
3. Define range/table/chart operations with transactional safeguards.
4. Mitigate locking, session expiry, and calc/refresh reliability issues.
