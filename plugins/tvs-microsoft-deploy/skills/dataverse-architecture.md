# Dataverse Architecture

Use this skill when users need durable table design, enterprise integration patterns, and scalable operational controls in Dataverse.

## Fast path
1. Capture domain model boundaries and data ownership.
2. Design tables, relationships, alternate keys, and audit strategy.
3. Map security model (business units, teams, field/table access).
4. Validate scale constraints, API limits, and archival approach.
