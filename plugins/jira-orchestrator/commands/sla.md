# Jira SLA Management Command

Monitor, configure, report on, and analyze SLA compliance across issues.

## Actions

| Action | Purpose | Args |
|--------|---------|------|
| **status** | Check SLA status | target, (format) |
| **configure** | Set SLA rules | target |
| **report** | Generate SLA report | target, time_period, (format) |
| **breach-analysis** | Analyze breaches | target, time_period |
| **dashboard** | Real-time monitoring | (auto-refresh) |

### Status
1. Parse target: issue key, priority, or 'all'
2. Calculate SLA for: first response, resolution, update frequency
3. Format output: summary (table), detailed (all metrics), json, or csv
4. Add recommendations if at-risk or breached
5. Show breach predictions with confidence levels
6. Consume Harness execution events via `lib/harness-transition-engine.ts` to keep SLA status transitions aligned with release orchestration and idempotent across webhook retries.

### Configure
1. Display current SLA rules
2. Prompt for changes (first response, resolution, update freq, business hours)
3. Validate: response < resolution, thresholds 50-95%, timezones valid
4. Apply changes, recalculate affected issues
5. Notify teams of changes

### Report
1. Collect data per time period: daily|weekly|monthly|quarterly|custom
2. Calculate overall metrics: compliance %, breaches, avg times, CSAT
3. Analyze trends: WoW/MoW comparison, anomalies
4. Generate output: summary|detailed|json|csv
5. Save to Obsidian vault

### Breach Analysis
1. Aggregate breach data by type, priority, tier
2. Perform root cause analysis: staffing, complexity, external deps, process, infrastructure
3. Identify patterns: time-of-day, day-of-week, teams, repeat issues
4. List preventive measures: implemented, in-progress, recommended
5. Flag compliance impacts (SOC2, contracts)

### Dashboard
1. Show real-time status: priority summary table
2. Alert on critical/at-risk issues
3. Display team workload capacity
4. Show 24h metrics: resolved, compliance %, breaches, avg times
5. Auto-refresh every 60 seconds

## Implementation

**Agent:** sla-monitor | **Calculations:** first response, resolution, update frequency

SLA Tracking:
- Business hours support (timezone-aware)
- Pause time tracking (customer wait, blocked, etc.)
- Breach prediction with confidence scoring
- Tier-based multipliers (Enterprise 0.5x, Premium 0.75x, Standard 1.0x)

## Best Practices

1. **Status:** Review weekly, prioritize at-risk issues
2. **Configure:** Validate before applying, test impact
3. **Reports:** Save monthly for compliance/trends
4. **Breach Analysis:** Use patterns to prevent future breaches
5. **Dashboard:** Monitor critical issues 24/7
