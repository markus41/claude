# Jira PR Creation Command

Create a comprehensive pull request for completed Jira issue work with automated validation, PR generation, and Jira updates.

## Step 0: Time Tracking Initialization

**AUTOMATIC**: This step runs silently before command execution begins.

The orchestration system tracks execution time for this command. When the command completes:
- If duration >= 60 seconds AND a Jira issue key is detected
- A worklog is automatically posted with comment: `[Claude] /jira:pr - {duration}`

### Issue Key Detection Priority
1. Command argument (e.g., `${issue_key}`)
2. Git branch name (e.g., `feature/PROJ-123-desc`)
3. Environment variable `JIRA_ISSUE_KEY`
4. Current orchestration session

### Configuration
Time logging can be configured in `jira-orchestrator/config/time-logging.yml`:
- `enabled`: Toggle auto-logging (default: true)
- `threshold_seconds`: Minimum duration to log (default: 60)
- `format`: Worklog comment format (default: "[Claude] {command} - {duration}")

---

## Issue Details

**Issue Key:** ${issue_key}
**Base Branch:** ${base}
**Draft PR:** ${draft}
**Reviewers:** ${reviewers}

## Step 1: Pre-flight Validation

Before creating the PR, validate that all work is complete and meets quality standards.

### Actions:
```
1. Validate issue key format matches pattern: [A-Z]+-[0-9]+
2. If invalid, respond with error and exit
3. Check git repository status:
   - Verify we are in a git repository
   - Check for uncommitted changes
   - Identify current branch
4. Verify work is complete:
   - All changes committed
   - Tests are passing
   - No merge conflicts with base branch
5. If any validation fails, halt and provide clear error message
```

### Validation Commands:
```bash
# Check git repository
git rev-parse --git-dir 2>&1

# Check for uncommitted changes
git status --porcelain

# Get current branch
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD

# Check if tests pass (project-specific, adapt as needed)
npm test || pytest || mvn test || ./gradlew test || echo "No test command configured"
```

### Validation Checklist:
- [ ] Valid Jira issue key format
- [ ] In a git repository
- [ ] No uncommitted changes (clean working directory)
- [ ] On a feature branch (not on main/master directly)
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] No merge conflicts with base branch

## Step 2: Fetch Jira Issue Details

Retrieve complete issue information to generate comprehensive PR description.

### Actions:
```
1. Use mcp__atlassian__jira_get_issue with issue_key parameter
2. Extract all relevant fields:
   - summary: Issue title
   - description: Full description with formatting
   - issuetype: Bug, Story, Task, Epic, etc.
   - status: Current status
   - priority: Issue priority
   - assignee: Assigned user
   - reporter: Reporter
   - labels: All labels
   - components: Components
   - fixVersions: Target versions
   - customfield_10016: Story points (adjust field ID for your instance)
   - customfield_10037: Acceptance criteria (adjust field ID for your instance)
   - subtasks: All subtasks if any
   - parent: Parent issue if exists
   - attachment: Screenshots or files
3. Parse acceptance criteria from description or custom field
4. Extract related issues and dependencies
5. Get issue history to understand recent changes
```

### Issue Data Structure:
```json
{
  "key": "${issue_key}",
  "fields": {
    "summary": "Issue title",
    "description": "Full description",
    "issuetype": {"name": "Story"},
    "status": {"name": "In Progress"},
    "priority": {"name": "High"},
    "assignee": {"displayName": "Developer"},
    "labels": ["backend", "api"],
    "components": [{"name": "Auth Service"}],
    "customfield_10016": 5,
    "customfield_10037": "Acceptance criteria text"
  }
}
```

## Step 3: Create or Verify Feature Branch

Ensure we're on the correct feature branch for this issue.

### Branch Naming Convention:
```
feature/${issue_key}-{short-description}

Examples:
  feature/ABC-123-user-authentication
  feature/PROJ-456-fix-memory-leak
  feature/DEV-789-add-logging
```

### Actions:
```
1. Get current branch name
2. Check if current branch follows convention (contains issue key)
3. If on main/master or incorrect branch:
   a. Check if feature branch already exists remotely
   b. If exists, checkout existing branch
   c. If not exists, create new feature branch from current HEAD
   d. Use kebab-case for description from issue summary
4. If already on correct feature branch, continue
5. Fetch latest base branch changes
6. Check for merge conflicts with base branch
```

### Branch Creation Commands:
```bash
# Get current branch
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Create feature branch if needed
BRANCH_NAME="feature/${issue_key}-$(echo '${summary}' | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '-' | cut -c1-50)"

# Check if branch exists remotely
git ls-remote --heads origin "$BRANCH_NAME" | grep -q "$BRANCH_NAME"

# Create or checkout branch
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  git checkout "$BRANCH_NAME"
  git pull origin "$BRANCH_NAME"
else
  git checkout -b "$BRANCH_NAME"
fi

# Fetch base branch
git fetch origin "${base}:${base}"

# Check for conflicts (don't merge, just check)
git merge-tree $(git merge-base HEAD origin/${base}) HEAD origin/${base} | grep -q '^<<<<<'
```

## Step 4: Analyze Changes

Review all changes since branching from base to generate accurate PR description.

### Actions:
```
1. Get commit history since branching from base branch
2. Analyze changed files and their purposes
3. Identify categories of changes:
   - Features added
   - Bugs fixed
   - Refactoring done
   - Tests added/modified
   - Documentation updated
   - Dependencies changed
   - Configuration modified
4. Count lines added/removed by category
5. Identify breaking changes or migrations needed
6. Extract key implementation details from commits
```

### Analysis Commands:
```bash
# Get commit history
git log origin/${base}..HEAD --oneline

# Get detailed diff
git diff origin/${base}...HEAD --stat

# Get changed files by type
git diff origin/${base}...HEAD --name-only | grep -E '\.(ts|tsx|js|jsx)$' # Frontend
git diff origin/${base}...HEAD --name-only | grep -E '\.(py|java|go)$' # Backend
git diff origin/${base}...HEAD --name-only | grep -E 'test|spec' # Tests
git diff origin/${base}...HEAD --name-only | grep -E '\.md$|docs/' # Docs

# Count changes
git diff origin/${base}...HEAD --shortstat
```

## Step 5: Generate PR Title

Create a clear, concise PR title following best practices.

### Title Format:
```
${issue_key}: ${summary}

Examples:
  ABC-123: Implement user authentication with OAuth2
  PROJ-456: Fix memory leak in image processing
  DEV-789: Add structured logging to payment service
```

### Title Rules:
```
1. Always prefix with Jira issue key
2. Use imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", not "Added", "Fixed", "Updated")
3. Keep under 72 characters
4. Capitalize first word after colon
5. No period at the end
6. Be specific and descriptive
```

### Title Generation:
```
# Extract summary from Jira
SUMMARY="${summary from Jira}"

# Clean and format
CLEAN_SUMMARY=$(echo "$SUMMARY" | sed 's/^[[:space:]]*//;s/[[:space:]]*$//' | cut -c1-60)

# Build title
PR_TITLE="${issue_key}: $CLEAN_SUMMARY"
```

## Step 6: Generate PR Description

Create comprehensive PR description using structured template.

### PR Description Template:
```markdown
## Summary

```

### PR Description Generation Steps:
```
1. Extract summary from Jira description
2. Categorize changed files into sections
3. Parse acceptance criteria from Jira custom field or description
4. Generate test coverage report
5. Create manual testing steps based on acceptance criteria
6. Identify breaking changes from commit messages
7. Extract migration files from changes
8. Identify new environment variables from config changes
9. List new dependencies from package.json/requirements.txt/pom.xml changes
10. Build related issues section from Jira links
11. Combine all sections into final PR body
```

## Step 7: Push Changes to Remote

Ensure all commits are pushed to remote repository.

### Actions:
```
1. Verify current branch is correct feature branch
2. Push branch to remote with -u flag to set upstream tracking
3. If push fails due to remote changes:
   a. Fetch and rebase on remote branch
   b. Resolve any conflicts
   c. Re-run tests after rebase
   d. Push again
4. Capture remote branch URL for PR creation
```

### Push Commands:
```bash
# Get current branch
BRANCH_NAME=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Push with upstream tracking
git push -u origin "$BRANCH_NAME"

# If push fails, try rebase
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  git fetch origin "$BRANCH_NAME"
  git rebase origin/"$BRANCH_NAME"

  # Re-run tests after rebase
  npm test || pytest || mvn test || ./gradlew test

  # Force push if rebase was needed (use with caution)
  git push -u origin "$BRANCH_NAME" --force-with-lease
fi
```

## Step 8: Dynamic Reviewer Selection

Use the agent-router to intelligently select domain-specific reviewers based on changed files and expertise requirements.

### Purpose:

Instead of relying on hardcoded reviewers, dynamically select specialized agents/reviewers who are best suited for reviewing the specific changes in this PR.

### Dynamic Selection Process:

```yaml
# Invoke agent-router with review phase
changed_files = $(git diff origin/${base}...HEAD --name-only)

reviewer_selection = agent_router.select(
  phase="REVIEW",
  changed_files="${changed_files}",
  issue_type="${issuetype from Jira}",
  issue_key="${issue_key}",
  model_filter="sonnet"  # Use sonnet for thorough review
)
```

### Agent Router Configuration:

The agent-router uses file-to-agent mappings defined in:
```
jira-orchestrator/config/file-agent-mapping.yaml
```

**Configuration structure:**
```yaml
# Example mappings
patterns:
  frontend:
    - "**/*.tsx"
    - "**/*.jsx"
    - "**/*.css"
    - "src/components/**"
    agents:
      - react-component-architect
      - accessibility-expert
      - ui-testing-specialist

  backend:
    - "**/*.py"
    - "**/*.java"
    - "src/services/**"
    - "src/api/**"
    agents:
      - backend-architect
      - database-specialist
      - api-security-expert

  infrastructure:
    - "**/*.tf"
    - "docker-compose.yml"
    - "k8s/**"
    - ".github/workflows/**"
    agents:
      - devops-engineer
      - security-engineer

  database:
    - "migrations/**"
    - "prisma/schema.prisma"
    - "src/db/**"
    agents:
      - database-specialist
      - data-architect
```

### Example Reviewer Selection Scenarios:

**Frontend Changes Only:**
```
Changed files: src/components/UserForm.tsx, src/styles/form.css
Selected reviewers: react-component-architect, accessibility-expert
```

**Backend API Changes:**
```
Changed files: src/services/auth.py, src/api/auth_endpoints.py
Selected reviewers: backend-architect, api-security-expert
```

**Database Migrations:**
```
Changed files: migrations/002_add_user_fields.sql, prisma/schema.prisma
Selected reviewers: database-specialist, data-architect
```

**Mixed Changes:**
```
Changed files:
  - src/components/Dashboard.tsx
  - src/services/analytics.py
  - migrations/003_add_analytics_table.sql
Selected reviewers: react-component-architect, backend-architect, database-specialist
```

### Actions:

```
1. Get list of changed files since branching from base
2. Invoke agent-router with changed files and issue context
3. Router analyzes file patterns against file-agent-mapping.yaml
4. Router returns list of recommended reviewer agents
5. Store recommended reviewers for Step 9 (Create PR)
6. Log reviewer selection reasoning for transparency
7. Allow manual override if needed (via reviewers argument)
```

### Selection Logic:

```bash
# Get changed files
CHANGED_FILES=$(git diff origin/${base}...HEAD --name-only)

# Invoke agent-router via MCP
REVIEWER_AGENTS=$(mcp__agent_router__select(
  phase="REVIEW",
  changed_files="${CHANGED_FILES}",
  issue_key="${issue_key}",
  issue_type="${issuetype}",
  model="sonnet"
))

# If manual reviewers specified, merge with dynamic selection
if [ -n "${reviewers}" ]; then
  # Combine manual + dynamic reviewers
  FINAL_REVIEWERS="${reviewers},$REVIEWER_AGENTS"
else
  # Use only dynamic reviewers
  FINAL_REVIEWERS="$REVIEWER_AGENTS"
fi

# Log the selection
echo "Dynamic Reviewer Selection:"
echo "  Changed files: $CHANGED_FILES"
echo "  Selected agents: $REVIEWER_AGENTS"
echo "  Final reviewers: $FINAL_REVIEWERS"
```

### Notes:

- If agent-router not available, fall back to manual reviewers argument
- Recommended reviewers can be overridden via the `--reviewers` argument
- Multiple reviewers from same domain can be selected for thorough review
- Review selection is logged in Jira comments for transparency
- Consider time zones and availability when selecting reviewers

## Step 9: Create Pull Request via GitHub CLI

Use gh CLI to create the pull request with all metadata and dynamically selected reviewers.

### Actions:
```
1. Verify gh CLI is installed and authenticated
2. Build PR creation command with all parameters:
   - Title from Step 5
   - Body from Step 6
   - Base branch from argument (default: main)
   - Head branch (current feature branch)
   - Draft flag if specified
   - Reviewers from Step 8 (dynamically selected or manual)
   - Labels from Jira issue labels
   - Milestone from Jira fixVersion
   - Project if configured
3. Execute gh pr create command
4. Capture PR number and URL from output
5. If PR creation fails, provide detailed error and rollback instructions
```

### PR Creation Command:
```bash
# Verify gh CLI
gh --version

# Check authentication
gh auth status

# Build labels from Jira
LABELS=$(echo "${labels from Jira}" | tr ',' '\n' | sed 's/^/--label /' | tr '\n' ' ')

# Build reviewers from Step 8 (dynamic selection or manual)
# FINAL_REVIEWERS was set in Step 8, use it here
REVIEWERS=$(echo "${FINAL_REVIEWERS}" | tr ',' '\n' | sed 's/^/--reviewer /' | tr '\n' ' ')

# Create PR with heredoc for body
gh pr create \
  --title "$PR_TITLE" \
  --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
{PR_BODY from Step 6}
EOF
)" \
  --base "${base}" \
  --head "$BRANCH_NAME" \
  $(if [ "${draft}" = "true" ]; then echo "--draft"; fi) \
  $LABELS \
  $REVIEWERS \
  --web

# Capture PR URL
PR_URL=$(gh pr view --json url --jq .url)
PR_NUMBER=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number)
```

### PR Metadata Configuration:
```
Title: From Step 5 (max 72 chars)
Body: From Step 6 (full markdown template)
Base: ${base} argument (default: main)
Head: Current feature branch
Draft: ${draft} argument (default: false)
Labels: Mapped from Jira labels + issue type
  - bug (if issuetype = Bug)
  - feature (if issuetype = Story)
  - task (if issuetype = Task)
  - {jira_label_1}
  - {jira_label_2}
Reviewers: ${FINAL_REVIEWERS} from Step 8 (dynamically selected via agent-router)
  - Source: ${REVIEWER_AGENTS} (auto-selected) + ${reviewers} (manual override if provided)
  - Selection method: agent-router with file-agent-mapping.yaml
  - Can be overridden via --reviewers argument
Assignees: Jira assignee (if mapping exists)
Milestone: Jira fixVersion (if exists)
Project: From repo configuration (if exists)
```

## Step 10: Update Jira Issue

Link the PR back to Jira and update issue status.

### Actions:
```
1. Add comment to Jira issue with PR details
2. Add PR URL to issue's development section (if supported)
3. Transition issue status based on PR state:
   - If draft PR: Keep in "In Progress"
   - If regular PR: Move to "In Review" or "Code Review"
4. Update issue with additional metadata:
   - Add label "has-pr"
   - Update custom field for PR URL if exists
5. If reviewers specified, mention them in Jira comment
```

### Jira Update Commands:
```
# Add comment with PR link
mcp__atlassian__jira_add_comment(
  issue_key="${issue_key}",
  comment="Pull request created: ${PR_URL}

## PR Summary
{Brief summary from PR description}

## Review Status
- State: $(if [ "${draft}" = "true" ]; then echo "Draft"; else echo "Ready for Review"; fi)
- Reviewers: ${FINAL_REVIEWERS} (dynamically selected via agent-router)
- Base branch: ${base}
- Feature branch: ${BRANCH_NAME}

## Reviewer Selection Details
Domain-specific reviewers were automatically selected based on changed files:

```

## Step 11: Request Reviews

Send review requests via GitHub using the dynamically selected reviewers.

### Actions:
```
1. Get reviewers from Step 8 (FINAL_REVIEWERS - dynamically selected or manual)
2. For each reviewer:
   a. Validate reviewer has access to repository
   b. Request review via gh CLI
   c. Handle errors if reviewer not found
3. If team reviewers specified (team:team-name):
   a. Request team review
4. Log reviewer selection details (which were auto-selected vs. manual)
5. Optionally notify reviewers via Slack/Teams integration
6. Log all review requests
```

### Review Request Commands:
```bash
# Use FINAL_REVIEWERS from Step 8 (dynamic selection + manual override)
# Split reviewers by comma
IFS=',' read -ra REVIEWER_ARRAY <<< "${FINAL_REVIEWERS}"

# Track which reviewers were dynamically selected vs. manually specified
DYNAMIC_REVIEWERS="${REVIEWER_AGENTS}"
MANUAL_REVIEWERS="${reviewers}"

# Request reviews
for reviewer in "${REVIEWER_ARRAY[@]}"; do
  # Trim whitespace
  reviewer=$(echo "$reviewer" | xargs)

  # Check if team review
  if [[ $reviewer == team:* ]]; then
    TEAM_NAME=${reviewer#team:}
    gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --add-reviewer "$TEAM_NAME"
  else
    # Individual reviewer
    gh pr edit "$PR_NUMBER" --add-reviewer "$reviewer"
  fi
done

# Add comment mentioning reviewers and selection method
REVIEWER_NOTE=""
if [ -n "$MANUAL_REVIEWERS" ]; then
  REVIEWER_NOTE="Review requested from (manual + dynamic selection): ${FINAL_REVIEWERS/,/, }"
else
  REVIEWER_NOTE="Review requested from (auto-selected by agent-router): ${FINAL_REVIEWERS/,/, }"
fi

gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body "$REVIEWER_NOTE"
```

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Reviewer Selection (NEW)

Leverage agent-router to automatically select domain-specific reviewers:
```
1. Agent-router analyzes changed files during Step 8
2. Compares against file-agent-mapping.yaml patterns
3. Selects specialized reviewers for each domain:
   - Frontend changes → react-component-architect, accessibility-expert
   - Backend changes → backend-architect, api-security-expert
   - Database changes → database-specialist, data-architect
   - Infrastructure → devops-engineer, security-engineer
4. Respects manual --reviewers argument if provided
5. Logs selection rationale in Jira for transparency
6. Enables faster, more focused code reviews
```

### Automatic Screenshot Detection

If UI changes detected, prompt for screenshots:
```
1. Analyze changed files for UI components (.tsx, .vue, .jsx, .html, .css)
2. If UI changes found:
   - Remind to add screenshots to PR description
   - Provide placeholder sections in PR body
   - Suggest using playwright for automated screenshots
```

### Automatic Changelog Generation

Generate changelog entry from commits:
```
1. Parse commit messages since base branch
2. Categorize by conventional commit type:
   - feat: Features
   - fix: Bug fixes
   - docs: Documentation
   - refactor: Refactoring
   - test: Tests
   - chore: Maintenance
3. Format as changelog entry
4. Add to PR body
```

### Breaking Change Detection

Automatically detect breaking changes:
```
1. Scan commit messages for "BREAKING CHANGE:"
2. Check for major version bumps in package.json
3. Detect API signature changes
4. Warn if breaking changes not documented
5. Add breaking change section to PR body
```

## Notes

- Always validate work is complete before creating PR
- Dynamic reviewer selection (Step 8) automatically assigns domain experts based on changed files
- If automatic selection doesn't work, fall back to manual --reviewers argument
- Use Context7 MCP for library documentation if needed
- PR description should be comprehensive enough for reviewers to understand changes without reading all code
- Screenshots are critical for UI changes
- Breaking changes must be clearly documented
- Keep PR focused on single issue (avoid scope creep)
- Link all related Jira issues
- Update PR description if scope changes during review
- Review selection logic is transparent and documented in Jira comments
- Consider agent expertise areas when evaluating reviewer feedback
