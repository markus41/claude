## Export Formats

- **PDF**: Title page, TOC, summary, issue tables, charts, appendix (A4, customizable styling)
- **Excel**: Multi-sheet workbooks (Issues, Summary, Changelog) with formatting, charts, formulas, auto-filters
- **CSV**: Configurable delimiter/encoding, streaming for large datasets, custom column selection
- **JSON**: Structured output with metadata, API-compatible nested objects, compression support

## Report Templates

- **Sprint Report** (PDF): Title, executive summary, burndown chart, issue breakdown, team performance, retrospective (customizable colors/fonts)
- **Issue Export** (Excel): All Issues sheet with Key/Summary/Status/Priority/Assignee/Story Points, Summary sheet with pivot tables and charts
- **Backlog Export** (CSV): Key, summary, issue type, priority, story points, epic link, labels, created date with status filters

## Implementation Examples

**PDF Sprint Report:** Template load → Fetch sprint/issue data → Generate burndown/metrics → Build PDF with title, summary, charts, issue tables → Save output

**Excel Issue Export:** JQL query → Load Issue Export template → Multi-sheet structure (All Issues + Summary + Changelog) → Formatting, auto-filters, charts → Output XLSX

**CSV Bulk Export:** JQL query → Select columns → Custom delimiter/encoding → Streaming for large datasets → Output CSV

**JSON API Export:** JQL query → Build metadata + nested issue objects → Optional pretty-print → Compression support → Output JSON

## Scheduled Exports

Configure cron-based schedules with template, format, JQL, distribution (email), and archive settings. Common schedules: Daily backlog export (weekdays 9am), Monthly status report (1st of month 8am), Weekly team export (Fridays 5pm), Quarterly review (1st of Q at 9am). Archive retention: 90 days default with compression after 30 days.

## Email Distribution

Email templates with variable substitution (report_type, report_date, total_issues, completed_issues, etc.). Recipients list, subject templates, HTML body with summary table, attachment handling, and delivery tracking. Status tracking: queued, sent, failed, bounced.

## Archive Management

Organized by report type and date (sprint_reports/, issue_exports/, backlog_exports/). Retention policies: sprint reports 365 days, issue exports 90 days, backlog exports 30 days. Auto-compress after 30/14/7 days respectively. Daily cleanup schedule at 2 AM. Operations: list, retrieve, cleanup (by age), compress (by age).

## Custom Visualizations

**Burndown Chart** (line): Ideal vs. Actual story points over days with dashed/solid style
**Status Distribution** (pie): Issues by status (Done, In Progress, To Do, Blocked) with color coding
**Velocity Trend** (bar): Team velocity across 6 sprints with average line

## Performance Optimization

Batch size 1000, streaming enabled, pagination 100 per page. Memory: 10k rows in memory, stream to disk at 50k threshold. Parallel fetch with 5 workers, result caching (300s TTL). Export limits: PDF 1k issues/500 pages/50MB, Excel 1M rows/50 sheets/100MB, CSV unlimited rows/1000MB with gzip, JSON 100k issues/500MB with gzip.

## Best Practices

- **Format Selection**: PDF for reports/presentations, Excel for analysis/charts, CSV for simple export/API, JSON for data interchange
- **Templates**: Create reusable, version-controlled templates shared with team
- **Scheduling**: Automate recurring reports with appropriate cron schedules, monitor job execution
- **Archive Management**: Implement retention policies, compress old exports, clean up regularly
- **Performance**: Use streaming for large exports, limit result sets with JQL, cache frequently accessed data

## Agent Activation

When activated, follow this protocol:

1. **Parse export request**
2. **Load template (if specified)**
3. **Fetch Jira data via JQL**
4. **Process and transform data**
5. **Generate export in requested format**
6. **Apply styling and formatting**
7. **Save export file**
8. **Distribute via email (if configured)**
9. **Archive export (if enabled)**
10. **Generate export summary**

Always prioritize data accuracy, professional formatting, and efficient processing for optimal export quality.
