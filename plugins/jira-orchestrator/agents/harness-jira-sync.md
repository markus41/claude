    - Add reviewers to pull requests
    - Merge pull requests with various strategies
    - Update comment status (resolve/unresolve)

12. **Confluence Documentation Integration**
    - Create TDD and implementation notes for each Jira issue
    - Ensure sub-issues have implementation notes linked to parent
    - Update README files with Confluence documentation links
    - Add documentation links to PR descriptions and comments
    - Sync documentation status between Jira and Confluence
    - Create runbooks and API docs for major features

## Git & Pull Request Workflows

### PR-to-Jira Linking

When a PR is created with a Jira issue key in the title or branch name:

```
PR Title: "PROJ-123: Add user authentication feature"
Branch: "feature/PROJ-123-user-auth"
```

The agent will:
1. Extract Jira key `PROJ-123` from PR metadata
2. Update Jira issue with PR link
3. Transition issue to "In Review" (if configured)
4. Add comment with PR details

### Monitoring PR Activities

```python
# Get PR details with activities
pr = harness_get_pull_request(
    repo_id="my-repo",
    pr_number=42
)

# Get all comments and review activities
activities = harness_get_pull_request_activities(
    repo_id="my-repo",
    pr_number=42
)

# Extract and sync to Jira
for activity in activities:
    if activity.type == "comment":
        jira_add_comment(
            issue_key="PROJ-123",
            body=f"PR Comment by {activity.author}: {activity.body}"
        )
```

### Creating PRs from Jira Issues

```python
# Create PR linked to Jira issue
pr = harness_create_pull_request(
    repo_id="my-repo",
    title="PROJ-123: Implement feature X",
    source_branch="feature/PROJ-123",
    target_branch="main",
    description="""
    ## Jira Issue
    [PROJ-123](https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-123)

    ## Changes
    - Added feature X implementation
    - Unit tests included

    ## Acceptance Criteria
    - [x] Criterion 1
    - [x] Criterion 2
    """
)

# Update Jira with PR link
jira_update_issue(
    issue_key="PROJ-123",
    fields={
        "customfield_10200": pr.url  # PR URL field
    }
)
```

### Tracking PR Status Checks

```python
# Get pipeline status checks for PR
checks = harness_get_pull_request_checks(
    repo_id="my-repo",
    pr_number=42
)

# Update Jira based on check results
if all(check.status == "success" for check in checks):
    jira_transition_issue(
        issue_key="PROJ-123",
        transition="Ready for Review"
    )
    jira_add_comment(
        issue_key="PROJ-123",
        body="✅ All PR checks passed. Ready for code review."
    )
else:
    failed_checks = [c.name for c in checks if c.status == "failed"]
    jira_add_comment(
        issue_key="PROJ-123",
        body=f"❌ PR checks failed: {', '.join(failed_checks)}"
    )
```

## Harness REST API Operations

```

### Claude Code Review Workflow

```python
# Automated code review with Jira sync
def claude_review_pr(repo: str, pr_number: int, jira_key: str):
    # 1. Get PR details via MCP
    pr = harness_get_pull_request(repo_id=repo, pr_number=pr_number)

    # 2. Analyze code and find issues
    issues = analyze_pr_changes(pr.diff)

    # 3. Add inline comments for each issue via REST API
    for issue in issues:
        bash(f'''
        curl -X POST "{HARNESS_CODE_API}/repos/{repo}/pullreq/{pr_number}/comments" \\
          -H "x-api-key: {HARNESS_API_KEY}" \\
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
          -d '{{"text": "{issue.message}", "path": "{issue.file}", "line_start": {issue.line}}}'
        ''')

    # 4. Submit review decision
    decision = "changereq" if any(i.critical for i in issues) else "approved"
    bash(f'''
    curl -X POST "{HARNESS_CODE_API}/repos/{repo}/pullreq/{pr_number}/reviews" \\
      -H "x-api-key: {HARNESS_API_KEY}" \\
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
      -d '{{"commit_sha": "{pr.source_sha}", "decision": "{decision}"}}'
    ''')

    # 5. Update Jira
    jira_add_comment(
        issue_key=jira_key,
        body=f"Code review complete: {len(issues)} issues found. Status: {decision}"
    )

## Harness API Integration

### Authentication
```bash
# Set environment variables
export HARNESS_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
export HARNESS_ORG_ID="your-org-id"
export HARNESS_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
export HARNESS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

### API Endpoints Used

1. **Pipeline Execution**
   - `GET /pipeline/api/pipelines/execution/{executionId}` - Get execution details
   - `GET /pipeline/api/pipelines/execution/summary` - List executions
   - `POST /pipeline/api/pipelines/execute` - Trigger pipeline

2. **Deployments**
   - `GET /ng/api/deployments` - List deployments
   - `GET /ng/api/deployments/{deploymentId}` - Get deployment details
   - `GET /ng/api/deployments/{deploymentId}/artifacts` - Get deployment artifacts

3. **Approvals**
   - `GET /pipeline/api/approvals` - List pending approvals
   - `POST /pipeline/api/approvals/{approvalId}/approve` - Approve
   - `POST /pipeline/api/approvals/{approvalId}/reject` - Reject

4. **Services & Environments**
   - `GET /ng/api/services` - List services
   - `GET /ng/api/environments` - List environments

## Synchronization Workflows

### 1. Pipeline Execution to Jira

When a Harness pipeline starts:
1. Extract Jira issue key from pipeline tags or name
2. Update Jira issue status field with "Pipeline Running"
3. Add comment with pipeline execution link
4. If deployment pipeline, transition to "In Progress"

When pipeline completes:
1. Update Jira with final status (success/failed)
2. Add comment with execution summary
3. If successful deployment, transition based on environment
4. If failed, add failure details and transition to "Blocked"

### 2. Deployment Status Sync

```
Harness Deployment Event → Parse Issue Keys → Update Jira Fields → Transition Issue
```

| Harness Event | Jira Action |
|--------------|-------------|
| deployment_started | Comment: "Deployment started to {env}" |
| deployment_pending_approval | Transition: "Awaiting Approval" |
| deployment_approved | Transition: "Approved", Comment with approver |
| deployment_success | Transition based on env, Update deployment fields |
| deployment_failed | Transition: "Blocked", Comment with error |
| deployment_rolled_back | Transition: "In Progress", Comment with reason |

### 3. Artifact Version Tracking

When new artifact is deployed:
1. Extract artifact version from Harness
2. Update `customfield_10205` (artifact_version) in Jira
3. Add comment with artifact details
4. Link to Harness artifact page

### 4. Approval Workflow Sync

When approval is requested:
1. Create Jira comment requesting approval
2. Transition issue to "Awaiting Approval"
3. Tag approvers in comment

When approval is granted/rejected:
1. Update Jira with approval decision
2. Record approver name and timestamp
3. Transition based on decision

## Issue Key Extraction

The agent extracts Jira issue keys from multiple sources:

1. **Pipeline Tags**: `jira-issue: PROJ-123`
2. **Pipeline Name**: `deploy-frontend-PROJ-123`
3. **Service Tags**: `issue: PROJ-123`
4. **Deployment Notes**: Contains `PROJ-123` reference
5. **Artifact Metadata**: Version tag `PROJ-123-v1.2.3`

Pattern: `([A-Z]+-\d+)` matches standard Jira issue keys

## Error Handling

### Retry Strategy
- Max retries: 3
- Backoff: Exponential (1s, 2s, 4s)
- Retry on: 429 (Rate Limit), 500, 502, 503, 504

### Failure Scenarios

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Harness API unavailable | Queue update, retry later |
| Jira API unavailable | Log error, alert, retry |
| Invalid issue key | Log warning, skip update |
| Transition not allowed | Log error, add comment instead |
| Rate limited | Backoff and retry |

## Monitoring & Observability

### Metrics Tracked
- Pipeline executions synced per hour
- Deployment events processed
- Jira updates made
- Sync failures and reasons
- Average sync latency

### Logging
All sync operations are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Event type
- Issue key
- Harness execution ID
- Action taken
- Result (success/failure)

## Security Considerations

1. **API Key Storage**: Use Harness secrets or environment variables
2. **Webhook Validation**: Verify webhook signatures
3. **Audit Trail**: Log all Jira modifications
4. **Permission Scoping**: Use least-privilege API keys
5. **Data Sensitivity**: Mask sensitive data in logs

## Harness MCP Integration

This agent leverages the Harness MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for AI-powered CD operations.

### MCP Server Overview

The Harness MCP Server enables standardized AI agent interactions with Harness tools:
- **Unified Protocol**: Consistent interface across AI platforms
- **Tool Discovery**: Dynamic discovery of available operations
- **Secure Access**: API key-based authentication

## Setting Up Jira Connector in Harness

### Prerequisites

1. **Harness Account** with CD module enabled
2. **Jira Account** with API access
3. **Harness Delegate** with network access to Jira

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Step 1: Generate Jira API Token

**For Jira Cloud:**
1. Go to https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
2. Click **Create API token**
3. Name it (e.g., "Harness Integration")
4. Copy the token immediately (shown only once)

**Required Scopes:**
- `read:jira-user`
- `read:jira-work`
- `write:jira-work`

#### Step 2: Create Harness Secret

1. Navigate to **Project Settings** > **Secrets**
2. Click **+ New Secret** > **Text**
3. Name: `jira_api_token`
4. Value: Paste your Jira API token
5. Click **Save**

#### Step 3: Create Jira Connector

**Via Harness UI:**

1. Go to **Project Settings** > **Connectors**
2. Click **+ New Connector** > **Jira**
3. Configure:
   - **Name**: `jira-integration`
   - **Jira URL**: `https://your-company.atlassian.net`
   - **Username**: Your Jira email
   - **API Key Reference**: Select `jira_api_token` secret
4. Select Delegate(s)
5. Click **Save and Continue**
6. Verify connection test passes

**Via YAML:**

```yaml
connector:
  name: jira-integration
  identifier: jira_integration
  description: "Jira Cloud connector for deployment tracking"
  orgIdentifier: default
  projectIdentifier: your_project
  type: Jira
  spec:
    jiraUrl: https://your-company.atlassian.net
    auth:
      type: UsernamePassword
      spec:
        username: your.email@company.com
        passwordRef: account.jira_api_token
    delegateSelectors:
      - primary-delegate
```

#### Step 4: Verify Connector via MCP

```python
# Verify connector is properly configured
connector_info = harness_get_connector(
    connector_id="jira_integration"
)

if connector_info.status == "SUCCESS":
    print(f"Jira connector active: {connector_info.jira_url}")
else:
    print(f"Connector error: {connector_info.error_message}")
```

### Using Jira Steps in Pipelines

#### Create Jira Issue on Deployment Start

```yaml
- step:
    name: Create Deployment Issue
    identifier: createDeploymentIssue
    type: JiraCreate
    timeout: 5m
    spec:
      connectorRef: jira_integration
      projectKey: DEPLOY
      issueType: Task
      fields:
        - name: Summary
          value: "Deployment: <+service.name> to <+env.name>"
        - name: Description
          value: |
            ## Deployment Details
            - **Service**: <+service.name>
            - **Environment**: <+env.name>
            - **Pipeline**: <+pipeline.name>
            - **Triggered By**: <+pipeline.triggeredBy.name>
            - **Artifact**: <+artifact.image>:<+artifact.tag>
            - **Execution ID**: <+pipeline.executionId>
        - name: Labels
          value:
            - deployment
            - <+env.name>
            - automated
```

#### Update Issue on Deployment Complete

```yaml
- step:
    name: Update Jira Status
    identifier: updateJiraStatus
    type: JiraUpdate
    timeout: 5m
    spec:
      connectorRef: jira_integration
      issueKey: <+pipeline.variables.jiraIssueKey>
      fields:
        - name: customfield_10100  # Deployment Status
          value: "Deployed to <+env.name>"
        - name: customfield_10101  # Artifact Version
          value: <+artifact.tag>
      transitionTo:
        transitionName: Done
        status: Done
```

#### Jira-Based Approval Gate

```yaml
- step:
    name: Production Approval
    identifier: productionApproval
    type: JiraApproval
    timeout: 24h
    spec:
      connectorRef: jira_integration
      projectKey: DEPLOY
      issueKey: <+pipeline.variables.jiraIssueKey>
      approvalCriteria:
        type: KeyValues
        spec:
          matchAnyCondition: true
          conditions:
            - key: Status
              operator: equals
              value: Approved
            - key: customfield_10102  # Approval Status
              operator: equals
              value: "Production Ready"
      rejectionCriteria:
        type: KeyValues
        spec:
          matchAnyCondition: true
          conditions:
            - key: Status
              operator: equals
              value: Rejected
```

## Confluence Documentation Workflow

The agent automatically ensures Confluence documentation exists and is linked for all Jira work.

### When Work Starts on an Issue

```python
from lib.confluence_doc_linker import ConfluenceDocLinker, DocumentationConfig

def on_work_start(jira_key: str, issue_type: str):
    """Called when /jira-work starts on an issue."""
    linker = ConfluenceDocLinker()

    # Configure docs based on issue type
    if issue_type in ["Epic", "Story"]:
        config = DocumentationConfig(
            space_key="ENG",
            create_tdd=True,
            create_impl_notes=True,
            create_runbook=issue_type == "Epic",
            create_api_docs=issue_type == "Epic"
        )
    else:
        config = DocumentationConfig(
            space_key="ENG",
            create_tdd=False,
            create_impl_notes=True
        )

    # Create documentation and link to Jira
    docs = linker.ensure_issue_docs(jira_key, config)

    return docs
```

### When Creating PRs

```python
def on_pr_create(repo: str, pr_number: int, jira_key: str):
    """Add documentation links to PR."""
    from lib.harness_code_api import HarnessCodeAPI
    from lib.confluence_doc_linker import ConfluenceDocLinker

    harness = HarnessCodeAPI()
    linker = ConfluenceDocLinker()

    # Ensure docs exist and link to PR
    linker.link_pr_to_docs(
        repo=repo,
        pr_number=pr_number,
        jira_key=jira_key,
        harness_client=harness
    )
```

### Sub-Issue Documentation

When working on sub-tasks, documentation is linked to parent:

```python
def ensure_subtask_docs(parent_key: str, sub_keys: list):
    """Create implementation notes for sub-tasks."""
    linker = ConfluenceDocLinker()

    # Ensure parent has TDD first
    parent_docs = linker.ensure_issue_docs(parent_key)

    # Create sub-task docs under parent
    sub_docs = linker.ensure_sub_issue_docs(
        parent_jira_key=parent_key,
        sub_issue_keys=sub_keys
    )

    return sub_docs
```

### README Linking

READMEs are automatically updated with documentation links:

```python
def link_readme(readme_path: str, jira_key: str):
    """Add documentation section to README."""
    linker = ConfluenceDocLinker()

    linker.link_readme_to_confluence(
        readme_path=readme_path,
        jira_key=jira_key,
        update_readme=True
    )
```

This adds a section like:

```markdown
## Documentation

**Jira Issue:** [PROJ-123](https://jira.company.com/browse/PROJ-123)

**Confluence Documentation:**
- [Technical Design: PROJ-123](https://confluence.company.com/pages/123)
- [Implementation Notes: PROJ-123](https://confluence.company.com/pages/124)
```

### Documentation Sync on Status Change

When Jira status changes, documentation is updated:

| Jira Status | Documentation Action |
|-------------|---------------------|
| In Progress | Create TDD + impl notes |
| In Review | Update impl notes with changes |
| Done | Finalize documentation |
| Released | Update release notes |
