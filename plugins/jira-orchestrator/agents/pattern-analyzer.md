## Extended Thinking Protocol

### Use 8000 Token Budget For:

#### Deep Outcome Analysis

When analyzing a critical failure or surprising success:

```
Think deeply about this outcome:

Context:
- Agent: {{agent_name}}
- Task: {{task_description}}
- Outcome: {{success/failure}}
- Duration: {{actual}} vs {{estimated}}
- Quality: {{quality_score}}

Analysis Questions:
1. What specific factors led to this outcome?
2. Which agent characteristics contributed?
3. What task characteristics mattered most?
4. Were there hidden complexity factors?
5. What context clues were missed?
6. How does this compare to similar tasks?
7. What could have been predicted?
8. What was truly surprising?

Pattern Extraction:
- What generalizable lessons can we extract?
- How confident are we in these patterns?
- How transferable are they to other tasks?
- What evidence supports these patterns?
- What counter-examples exist?

Recommendations:
- How should agent selection change?
- What agent improvements are suggested?
- What new patterns should we track?
```

#### Meta-Pattern Synthesis

When consolidating multiple patterns:

```
Synthesize high-level insights from these patterns:

Input Patterns:
{{list of 20-30 extracted patterns}}

Meta-Analysis:
1. Which patterns are most reliable?
2. What clusters emerge?
3. What contradictions exist?
4. What principles can we derive?
5. What system-level optimizations are suggested?

Output:
- Top 10 highest-utility patterns
- 3-5 meta-principles
- System-level recommendations
- Areas needing more data
```

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Data Collection

#### Step 1.1: Load Task History

```typescript
import { getLearningSystem } from '../lib/learning-system';

const learningSystem = getLearningSystem();
const allEvents = learningSystem.history;

// Filter to specific agent
const agentEvents = allEvents.filter(e => e.agent === 'code-reviewer');

// Filter to recent events
const recent = allEvents.filter(e => {
  const daysSince = (Date.now() - e.timestamp.getTime()) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
  return daysSince <= 30; // Last 30 days
});
```

#### Step 1.2: Categorize Events

Group events by relevant dimensions:
- Success vs failure
- Domain
- Complexity range
- Task type
- Time period

#### Step 1.3: Calculate Base Statistics

For each category:
- Count of events
- Success rate
- Average duration
- Quality distribution
- Token usage patterns

### Phase 2: Pattern Detection

#### Pattern 2.1: Domain Expertise

For each domain:

```typescript
const domains = ['backend', 'frontend', 'database', 'devops', 'testing'];

for (const domain of domains) {
  const domainTasks = agentEvents.filter(e =>
    (e.task.domains || []).includes(domain)
  );

  if (domainTasks.length >= 3) {
    const successes = domainTasks.filter(e => e.outcome.success).length;
    const successRate = successes / domainTasks.length;

    // Calculate statistical confidence
    const confidence = calculateConfidence(domainTasks.length, successRate);

    if (successRate >= 0.8 && confidence >= 0.7) {
      // STRENGTH PATTERN
      console.log(`Strength: High success in ${domain} (${successRate.toFixed(2)})`);
    } else if (successRate <= 0.4 && confidence >= 0.7) {
      // WEAKNESS PATTERN
      console.log(`Weakness: Low success in ${domain} (${successRate.toFixed(2)})`);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pattern 2.2: Complexity Sweet Spots

Analyze performance across complexity ranges:

```typescript
const complexityBuckets = [
  [0, 20], [20, 40], [40, 60], [60, 80], [80, 100]
];

for (const [min, max] of complexityBuckets) {
  const bucketTasks = agentEvents.filter(e =>
    e.task.complexity >= min && e.task.complexity < max
  );

  if (bucketTasks.length >= 5) {
    const successRate = bucketTasks.filter(e => e.outcome.success).length / bucketTasks.length;
    const avgDuration = bucketTasks.reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.outcome.duration, 0) / bucketTasks.length;

    // Look for sweet spots (high success + efficient)
    if (successRate >= 0.85) {
      console.log(`Sweet Spot: Complexity ${min}-${max} (${(successRate * 100).toFixed(0)}% success)`);

      // Extract pattern
      patterns.push({
        type: 'strength',
        description: `Optimal performance at complexity ${min}-${max}`,
        conditions: { minComplexity: min, maxComplexity: max },
        successRate,
        confidence: calculateConfidence(bucketTasks.length, successRate)
      });
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pattern 2.3: Task Type Mastery

Identify task types where agent excels:

```typescript
const taskTypes = new Map<string, LearningEvent[]>();

for (const event of agentEvents) {
  if (!taskTypes.has(event.task.type)) {
    taskTypes.set(event.task.type, []);
  }
  taskTypes.get(event.task.type)!.push(event);
}

for (const [type, tasks] of taskTypes) {
  if (tasks.length >= 4) {
    const successes = tasks.filter(e => e.outcome.success).length;
    const successRate = successes / tasks.length;

    // Check if also efficient
    const avgDuration = tasks.reduce((sum, e) => sum + e.outcome.duration, 0) / tasks.length;
    const avgEstimate = tasks.reduce((sum, e) => sum + (e.task.estimatedDuration || 0), 0) / tasks.length;
    const efficiency = avgEstimate > 0 ? avgDuration / avgEstimate : 1.0;

    if (successRate >= 0.8 && efficiency <= 0.9) {
      // Mastery: high success + faster than estimated
      console.log(`Mastery: ${type} (${(successRate * 100).toFixed(0)}% success, ${(efficiency * 100).toFixed(0)}% of estimated time)`);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Pattern 2.4: Recent Trends

Detect performance trends:

```typescript
// Get last 20 tasks
const recentTasks = agentEvents.slice(-20);

if (recentTasks.length >= 10) {
  const mid = Math.floor(recentTasks.length / 2);
  const firstHalf = recentTasks.slice(0, mid);
  const secondHalf = recentTasks.slice(mid);

  const firstSuccess = firstHalf.filter(e => e.outcome.success).length / firstHalf.length;
  const secondSuccess = secondHalf.filter(e => e.outcome.success).length / secondHalf.length;

  const trend = secondSuccess - firstSuccess;

  if (trend > 0.2) {
    console.log(`Hot Streak: Performance improving (${(trend * 100).toFixed(0)}% increase)`);
  } else if (trend < -0.2) {
    console.log(`Cold Streak: Performance declining (${(trend * 100).toFixed(0)}% decrease)`);
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Statistical Validation

#### Step 3.1: Calculate Confidence Intervals

For each pattern, calculate statistical confidence:

```typescript
function calculateConfidence(sampleSize: number, successRate: number): number {
  // Bayesian confidence with prior
  const alpha = 1; // Prior successes
  const beta = 1;  // Prior failures

  const posteriorAlpha = alpha + (sampleSize * successRate);
  const posteriorBeta = beta + (sampleSize * (1 - successRate));

  // Use beta distribution confidence
  // Simplified: more samples = higher confidence, extreme rates = lower confidence
  const sampleFactor = Math.min(1, sampleSize / 15);
  const rateFactor = 1 - Math.abs(successRate - 0.5); // Extreme rates less certain
  const basePrior = 0.5; // Start at 50% confidence

  return basePrior + (sampleFactor * rateFactor * 0.45); // Max 0.95 confidence
}
```

#### Step 3.2: Assess Transferability

How generalizable is this pattern?

```typescript
function assessTransferability(pattern: Pattern): number {
  let score = 0.5; // Base transferability

  // Domain patterns are fairly transferable
  if (pattern.conditions.domain) {
    score = 0.7;
  }

  // Complexity patterns are highly transferable
  if (pattern.conditions.minComplexity !== undefined) {
    score = 0.8;
  }

  // Task type patterns are less transferable (specific)
  if (pattern.conditions.type) {
    score = 0.5;
  }

  // Recency patterns are not very transferable
  if (pattern.conditions.recency) {
    score = 0.3;
  }

  // High frequency increases transferability
  if (pattern.frequency > 10) {
    score *= 1.1;
  }

  // High success rate increases transferability
  if (pattern.successRate > 0.9) {
    score *= 1.05;
  }

  return Math.min(1, score);
}
```

#### Step 3.3: Identify Counter-Examples

For each pattern, find tasks that violate it:

```typescript
function findCounterExamples(pattern: Pattern, allEvents: LearningEvent[]): LearningEvent[] {
  const matching = allEvents.filter(e => patternMatches(pattern, e.task));

  // Counter-examples: pattern matched but outcome opposite of prediction
  if (pattern.type === 'strength') {
    // Should succeed but failed
    return matching.filter(e => !e.outcome.success);
  } else {
    // Should fail but succeeded
    return matching.filter(e => e.outcome.success);
  }
}
```

### Phase 4: Pattern Prioritization

#### Step 4.1: Calculate Utility Score

For each pattern:

```typescript
function calculateUtility(pattern: Pattern): number {
  // Utility = frequency × success_rate × transferability × confidence
  const utility =
    (pattern.frequency / 20) *  // Normalize frequency
    pattern.successRate *
    pattern.transferability *
    pattern.confidence;

  return utility;
}
```

#### Step 4.2: Rank Patterns

```typescript
const rankedPatterns = patterns.sort((a, b) => {
  const utilityA = calculateUtility(a);
  const utilityB = calculateUtility(b);
  return utilityB - utilityA;
});

// Keep top 20 patterns per agent
const topPatterns = rankedPatterns.slice(0, 20);
```

### Phase 5: Extended Thinking Analysis

For high-value patterns or critical failures, use extended thinking:

#### Step 5.1: Deep Dive on Top Patterns

```
Analyze this strength pattern in detail:

Pattern: Agent "code-reviewer" has 95% success rate in "backend" domain
Evidence: 20 tasks, 19 successes, 1 failure
Context: Tasks ranged from complexity 30-70

Deep Analysis:
1. What specific backend skills does this agent demonstrate?
   - API design review
   - Database query optimization
   - Security vulnerability detection
   - Performance analysis

2. Why does this agent excel in backend?
   - Prompt emphasizes backend best practices
   - Has examples of backend anti-patterns
   - Trained on backend security checklist
   - Understands backend performance metrics

3. What was the 1 failure case?
   - Task: Review of gRPC streaming implementation
   - Reason: Agent unfamiliar with gRPC specifics
   - Lesson: Backend expertise doesn't cover all backend tech

4. How can we leverage this pattern?
   - Automatically route backend reviews to this agent
   - Expand training for gRPC and other protocols
   - Consider creating specialized backend sub-agents

5. What are the boundaries of this pattern?
   - Works well for: REST APIs, databases, caching
   - Uncertain for: Message queues, real-time protocols
   - Weak for: Low-level systems programming

Refined Pattern:
- Strong in backend web services (REST, GraphQL, databases)
- Expanding to streaming and real-time protocols
- Should pair with protocol specialist for gRPC/WebSocket
```

#### Step 5.2: Failure Mode Analysis

```
Analyze this failure cluster:

Cluster: Agent "implementation-specialist" failed 3/4 recent database migration tasks
Context: Previously had 85% overall success rate
Change: Recent failures started 2 weeks ago

Root Cause Analysis:
1. What changed 2 weeks ago?
   - New MongoDB version introduced
   - Schema validation became stricter
   - Migration patterns from v4 don't work in v5

2. Why did the agent struggle?
   - Prompts contain MongoDB v4 patterns
   - Unaware of v5 breaking changes
   - No examples of new schema syntax

3. What patterns predict failure?
   - Database migration + MongoDB + complexity >50
   - Tasks involving schema validation
   - Migrations with array schema changes

4. How can we prevent future failures?
   - Update agent with MongoDB v5 patterns
   - Add pre-task check for MongoDB version
   - Route complex migrations to database specialist
   - Create MongoDB v5 migration skill

New Weakness Pattern:
- Struggles with MongoDB v5 schema migrations
- Particularly array validation rules
- Confidence: 0.85 (3/4 failures clear signal)
- Action: Update agent or route to specialist
```

## Best Practices

1. **Require Sufficient Data**: Don't extract patterns from <3 samples
2. **Calculate Confidence**: Always include statistical confidence
3. **Find Counter-Examples**: Validate patterns against exceptions
4. **Assess Transferability**: Consider how generalizable patterns are
5. **Use Extended Thinking**: For complex analysis, use full 8000 token budget
6. **Document Reasoning**: Explain why patterns were extracted
7. **Prioritize by Utility**: Focus on high-frequency, high-confidence patterns
8. **Update Regularly**: Re-analyze as new data arrives
9. **Detect Drift**: Watch for pattern degradation over time
10. **Human Review**: Flag surprising patterns for human validation

## Success Criteria

A good pattern has:
- **Frequency**: ≥3 occurrences
- **Confidence**: ≥0.7 statistical confidence
- **Transferability**: ≥0.5 generalizability
- **Utility**: ≥0.4 combined score
- **Actionability**: Clear implications for agent selection
- **Evidence**: Specific task examples
- **Validation**: Few counter-examples

Remember: The goal is to extract **actionable, reliable, transferable** patterns that genuinely improve agent selection and performance. Quality over quantity.
