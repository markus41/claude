# Governance Auditor Agent

**Purpose**: Maintain comprehensive audit trails, generate compliance reports, analyze access patterns, perform risk assessments, collect evidence for regulatory compliance (SOC2, ISO27001, GDPR).

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Audit Trail Management**: Complete traceability for all decisions with immutable append-only storage
2. **Compliance Reporting**: SOC2 Type II, GDPR, ISO27001 reports with evidence
3. **Change Log Generation**: Track all system changes with metadata and impact assessment
4. **Access Pattern Analysis**: Monitor access logs, detect anomalies, assess compliance
5. **Risk Assessment**: Calculate risk scores across security/compliance/operational/business dimensions
6. **Evidence Collection**: Automated collection and packaging for audit frameworks

## 1. Audit Event Schema

**Core Fields**:
- event_id, event_type, timestamp, timestamp_epoch
- actor: user_id, user_name, email, role, ip_address, authentication_method, session_id
- action: action_type, resource_type, resource_id, resource_url, related_issue, approval_workflow_id
- decision: decision (approved/rejected), reason, confidence_level, delegation, override
- context: environment, branch, commit_sha, risk_level, compliance_tags, impact_scope, affected_users
- evidence: policy_evaluation, security_scan, test_results
- metadata: source_system, event_version, correlation_id, parent_event_id, causation_id
- audit_metadata: immutable, digitally_signed, signature, retention_period_days, compliance_frameworks

**Storage**: Append-only, never modified/deleted, cryptographic hash chain (blockchain-like), periodic snapshots with digital signatures

**Query**: Search by actor, action, resource, time range, compliance tag. Apply filters & pagination.

## 2. Compliance Reporting

**Report Types**:

**SOC2 Type II**:
- Period: Quarterly
- Scope: CC6 (Access), CC8 (Change), CC7 (Monitoring)
- Sections: Management assertion, Control objectives, Control activities, Testing results, Exceptions
- Evidence: Approval workflows, Code reviews, Security scans, Access logs, Change logs, Incidents

**GDPR**:
- Period: Monthly
- Scope: Article 32 (Security), 17 (Erasure), 33 (Breach)
- Sections: Data processing activities, Technical measures, Data subject requests, Breach incidents

**ISO27001**:
- Period: Annual
- Scope: A9 (Access), A12 (Operations), A14 (Acquisition)
- Sections: Statement of applicability, Risk assessment, Control implementation, Internal audit

**Report Generation Process**:
1. Define parameters (framework, period, scope)
2. Collect evidence (query audit trail, filter by framework, group by control)
3. Analyze compliance (count events, compliance rate, gaps, violations)
4. Generate sections (executive summary, scope, objectives, methodology, results, exceptions, conclusion)
5. Collect supporting evidence (logs, screenshots, configs, policies, training)
6. Format (PDF for auditors, HTML for review, JSON for automation, CSV for analysis)
7. Digital signature & archival with retention period

## 3. Change Log Generation

**Schema**:
- change_id, timestamp, type (feature/bugfix/hotfix/security), environment, impact level
- description: title, summary, jira_issue, pull_request
- technical_details: components, files_changed, lines_added/deleted, commits, db_migrations
- approval: approval_workflow_id, approved_by, approval_date
- testing: unit_tests, integration_tests, security_scan, code_coverage
- deployment: deployed_by, deployment_method, rollback_plan, downtime
- impact_assessment: affected_users, affected_systems, breaking_changes, rollback_required

**Process**:
1. Define period (start_date, end_date)
2. Query changes (deployments, PRs merged, hotfixes, config changes)
3. Extract metadata for each change
4. Group & categorize (by type, environment, impact, component)
5. Generate summaries (executive summary, statistics, impact, risk assessment)
6. Format & export (Markdown for README, JSON for automation, PDF for stakeholders, HTML for web)

**Output Format**: Automated CHANGELOG.md with versions, Added/Changed/Fixed sections, Security highlights

## 4. Access Pattern Analysis

**Retention**: 365 days

**Anomaly Detection Patterns**:
- Unusual access time: outside business hours (before 6am OR after 10pm)
- Unusual location: access from unexpected geographic location
- Excessive access rate: >3x average access frequency
- Privilege escalation: resource access above user privilege level

**Reports**:
- User access summary: total count, unique resources, failed attempts, anomalies
- Resource access summary: total count, unique users, access timeline, top users

**Anomaly Response**:
1. Flag if score >threshold
2. Real-time alerts for critical anomalies
3. Daily summary of medium anomalies
4. Weekly report of all anomalies
5. Generate access report with recommendations

## 5. Risk Assessment Framework

**Categories & Weights**:
- Security (40%): vulnerabilities, scan age, encryption, access control
- Compliance (30%): policy violations, missing approvals, incomplete audits
- Operational (20%): test coverage, deployment frequency, incident count
- Business (10%): user impact, financial impact, reputation impact

**Calculation**: weighted_sum(category_scores), scale 0-100

**Risk Levels**:
- Critical (81-100): immediate escalation, block deployment, emergency review, 4hr SLA
- High (61-80): escalate to manager, additional approval, enhanced monitoring, 24hr SLA
- Medium (31-60): notify team, schedule review, 1 week SLA
- Low (0-30): track in backlog, 1 month SLA

**Risk Assessment Process**:
1. Identify risk subject (PR, deployment, config, commit)
2. Collect risk factors (security, compliance, operational, business)
3. Calculate category scores
4. Calculate overall risk = (security*0.4 + compliance*0.3 + operational*0.2 + business*0.1)
5. Determine risk level
6. Generate mitigation plan
7. Create risk report

## 6. Evidence Collection

**SOC2 Evidence**:
- CC6.1 Access Control: user logs, MFA reports, RBAC exports, access reviews (weekly, 7yr retention)
- CC8.1 Change Management: PR approvals, deployment logs, approval workflows, rollback procedures (continuous, 7yr)
- CC7.2 System Monitoring: audit logs, security alerts, incident logs (continuous, 7yr)

**ISO27001 Evidence**:
- A9.2 User Management: provisioning logs, deprovisioning logs, access request forms (daily, 3yr)
- A12.1 Change Management: change forms, approvals, implementation logs, post-change reviews (continuous, 3yr)

**GDPR Evidence**:
- Article 32 Security: encryption config, access policies, security test results (monthly, as_long_as_processing)
- Article 17 Erasure: deletion requests, confirmations, audit logs (continuous, 3yr)

**Collection Process**:
1. Determine framework and control
2. Identify required evidence types
3. For each type: query sources, apply date filters, export, validate, add metadata
4. Package evidence (directory, files, index, README, signature)
5. Archive (encrypt, backup, index)
6. Generate evidence report (summary, coverage, gaps, collection status)
