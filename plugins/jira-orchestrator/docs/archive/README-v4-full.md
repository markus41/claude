6. Generates execution plan with recommended agents

**Example:**
```yaml
# Input: PROJ-123 with labels ["frontend", "react", "api"]
# Files: ["src/components/Button.tsx", "api/users/route.ts"]

agent_recommendation:
  recommended_agents:
    - name: react-component-architect
      score: 95
      model: sonnet
      rationale: "Matched: frontend domain, .tsx files, react keyword"
    - name: api-integration-specialist
      score: 90
      model: sonnet
      rationale: "Matched: backend domain, api/ directory"
  execution_plan:
    parallel_execution: true
    model_distribution:
      sonnet: 2
```

This agent bridges the gap between workflow-specific agents (29 in jira-orchestrator) and code specialists (142+ in main registry), ensuring every task is handled by the most qualified domain experts.

## Dynamic Agent Discovery

The Jira Orchestrator includes an **intelligent agent routing system** that dynamically selects the most qualified specialists from the main registry (142+ code agents) based on Jira context, file patterns, and task requirements.

### Overview

Instead of relying on generic "frontend-dev" or "backend-dev" placeholders, the Agent Router (`agent-router`) analyzes multiple signals to select domain-specific experts:

- **Jira Context**: Labels, components, issue type, keywords from description
- **File Patterns**: Extensions, directory structure, modified files from git diff
- **Task Keywords**: Technical terms, frameworks, libraries mentioned
- **Orchestration Phase**: EXPLORE, PLAN, CODE, TEST, FIX, DOCUMENT, REVIEW, VALIDATE

### Why Dynamic Discovery?

**Traditional Approach (Static):**
```
Issue: "Update authentication flow"
Agents: frontend-dev, backend-dev, test-writer
```

**Dynamic Discovery Approach:**
```
Issue: "Update authentication flow"
Labels: ["auth", "keycloak", "frontend", "backend"]
Files: ["keycloak/realms/app-realm.json", "src/components/LoginForm.tsx", "api/auth/route.ts"]

Selected Agents:
1. keycloak-identity-specialist (score: 95) - Keycloak realm configuration expert
2. react-component-architect (score: 92) - React UI components
3. api-integration-specialist (score: 90) - API endpoints
4. test-writer-fixer (score: 85) - Comprehensive testing
```

**Benefits:**
- Matches tasks to true domain experts (not generalists)
- Bridges workflow agents (29) with code specialists (142+)
- Reduces errors from mismatched expertise
- Improves code quality through specialization
- Optimizes model usage (opus/sonnet/haiku)

### How It Works

#### 1. Multi-Signal Analysis

The Agent Router combines multiple signals into a unified score (0-100):

| Signal | Weight | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Keywords** | 40% | "prisma", "schema", "migration" → prisma-specialist |
| **Domain Match** | 30% | `.tsx` files → frontend domain → react-component-architect |
| **Capabilities** | 20% | Requires "keycloak_realms" → keycloak-identity-specialist |
| **Priority** | 10% | High-priority agents get +10 bonus |

#### 2. Domain Detection

The system identifies 15 domains from file patterns and Jira labels:

| Domain | Triggers | Primary Agents |
|--------|----------|----------------|
| **frontend** | `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `components/`, labels: ["react", "ui"] | react-component-architect, accessibility-expert |
| **backend** | `api/`, `.ts` (non-component), labels: ["api", "server"] | api-integration-specialist, code-architect |
| **database** | `.prisma`, `.sql`, `migrations/`, labels: ["database", "schema"] | prisma-specialist, data-architect |
| **auth** | `keycloak/`, `auth/`, labels: ["authentication", "oauth"] | keycloak-identity-specialist, security-specialist |
| **testing** | `.test.tsx`, `__tests__/`, labels: ["testing", "qa"] | test-writer-fixer, e2e-test-specialist |
| **devops** | `Dockerfile`, `k8s/`, `helm/`, labels: ["deployment", "k8s"] | k8s-architect, helm-chart-developer |
| **graphql** | `.graphql`, `.gql`, labels: ["graphql"] | graphql-specialist |
| **ai** | `ai/`, `embeddings/`, labels: ["ai", "ml"] | ai-engineer, llm-integration-specialist |
| **infrastructure** | `terraform/`, `.tf`, labels: ["terraform", "iac"] | terraform-specialist, cloud-architect |
| **caching** | `redis/`, `cache/`, labels: ["redis", "cache"] | redis-specialist, performance-optimizer |
| **messaging** | `kafka/`, `events/`, labels: ["kafka", "messaging"] | kafka-specialist, event-driven-architect |
| **monitoring** | `metrics/`, `tracing/`, labels: ["observability"] | observability-specialist |
| **documentation** | `.md`, `docs/`, labels: ["documentation"] | codebase-documenter, technical-writer |
| **config** | `.config.ts`, `.env`, `config/` | code-architect, devops-specialist |

See full domain definitions in `config/file-agent-mapping.yaml`.

#### 3. Phase-Aware Selection

Different orchestration phases require different specialists:

| Phase | Focus | Agent Overrides |
|-------|-------|-----------------|
| **EXPLORE** | Analysis & discovery | +analyze-codebase, +requirements-analyzer, +dependency-mapper |
| **PLAN** | Architecture & design | +code-architect, +design-pattern-specialist |
| **CODE** | Implementation | Domain primary agents (no overrides) |
| **TEST** | Testing & validation | +test-writer-fixer, +coverage-analyzer, +qa-specialist (override primary) |
| **FIX** | Debugging & fixes | +bug-detective, +error-analyzer, +debugger-specialist |
| **DOCUMENT** | Documentation | +codebase-documenter, +technical-writer (override primary) |
| **REVIEW** | Code review & quality | +code-reviewer, +security-auditor, +best-practices-enforcer |
| **VALIDATE** | Final validation | +smart-commit-validator, +integration-tester |

#### 4. Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_agent_score(agent, context):
    score = 0

    # Keyword Match (40%)
    keyword_matches = len(agent.keywords & context.keywords)
    score += (keyword_matches / len(context.keywords)) * 40

    # Domain Match (30%)
    if agent.category in context.detected_domains:
        score += 30

    # Capability Match (20%)
    capability_matches = len(agent.capabilities & context.required_capabilities)
    score += (capability_matches / len(context.required_capabilities)) * 20

    # Priority Bonus (10%)
    if agent.priority == "high":
        score += 10
    elif agent.priority == "medium":
        score += 5

    return min(score, 100)  # Cap at 100
```

#### 5. Fallback Strategies

When no clear match exists (score < 50):

- **Low confidence routing**: Use general-purpose agents (code-architect, analyze-codebase)
- **Manual review flag**: Set `require_manual_review: true`
- **Phase-specific fallbacks**: Each phase has minimum agent requirements
- **Documented uncertainty**: Output includes why no match was found

### Configuration

The Dynamic Agent Discovery system is configured via two files:

#### 1. Agent Registry (`.claude/registry/agents.index.json`)

Contains metadata for all 142+ code agents:

```json
{
  "frontend": {
    "react-component-architect": {
      "name": "react-component-architect",
      "description": "React component architecture and design patterns",
      "keywords": ["react", "component", "tsx", "jsx", "hooks"],
      "capabilities": ["react_patterns", "component_design", "state_management"],
      "priority": "high",
      "model": "sonnet"
    }
  }
}
```

#### 2. Domain Mappings (`jira-orchestrator/config/file-agent-mapping.yaml`)

Defines 15 domains with:

- **Keywords**: Triggers for domain detection
- **File Patterns**: Glob patterns matching files
- **Directory Hints**: Path segments boosting domain score
- **Primary Agents**: Recommended specialists for each domain
- **Priority**: Used when multiple domains match
- **Jira Label Mappings**: Map Jira labels to domains
- **Phase Overrides**: Phase-specific agent recommendations

**Example Domain Definition:**

```yaml
domains:
  database:
    description: "Database schemas, migrations, ORM configurations"
    priority: 95
    keywords:
      - prisma
      - schema
      - migration
      - sql
      - database
    primary_agents:
      - prisma-specialist
      - database-specialist
      - data-architect
    file_patterns:
      - "*.prisma"
      - "prisma/**/*"
      - "migrations/**/*"
      - "*.sql"
```

### Integration with Workflows

The Agent Router is automatically invoked during workflow execution:

**Phase 3: CODE (Updated)**

**Goal:** Implement the solution with specialized code agents

**Activities:**
- **Agent Router analyzes context** (Jira issue + file patterns)
- **Selects domain specialists** (replaces generic placeholders)
- Write production code using selected experts
- Implement tests with testing specialists
- Handle edge cases with domain knowledge
- Commit with clear messages

**Agents (dynamically selected):**
- Determined by Agent Router based on:
  - Detected domains (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
  - Jira labels and components
  - File patterns from planned changes
  - Phase requirements (CODE phase)

**Example Selections:**
- Frontend-only: `react-component-architect`, `accessibility-expert`
- Backend API: `api-integration-specialist`, `graphql-specialist`
- Database: `prisma-specialist`, `data-modeling-specialist`
- Full-stack: Mix of above based on files changed

**Output:**
- Implemented feature by domain experts
- Comprehensive tests
- Git commits with issue references

### Usage Examples

### Best Practices

**For Jira Issues:**
1. Use descriptive labels (frontend, backend, database, auth, etc.)
2. Set accurate components (UI, API, Database, Auth, etc.)
3. Mention technologies in description (React, Prisma, Keycloak, etc.)
4. Include file paths in acceptance criteria when known

**For Workflows:**
1. Let Agent Router run automatically during `/jira:work`
2. Review recommended agents before spawning
3. Trust high-confidence (>80) recommendations
4. Manually review low-confidence (<50) selections
5. Add custom labels if router misclassifies

**For Configuration:**
1. Update `file-agent-mapping.yaml` as codebase evolves
2. Add new domains when introducing new technologies
3. Refine keyword lists based on routing outcomes
4. Adjust scoring weights if needed
5. Document domain-specific patterns

### Monitoring & Metrics

Track routing effectiveness:

- **Accuracy**: % of correct agent selections (validated by outcomes)
- **Coverage**: % of domains correctly identified
- **Confidence Distribution**: High (>80), Medium (50-80), Low (<50)
- **Fallback Rate**: % of tasks requiring fallback agents
- **Agent Utilization**: Which specialists are most frequently recommended
- **Model Efficiency**: Cost savings from optimal model assignments

### Continuous Improvement

The system learns from routing outcomes:

- Track successful vs failed agent recommendations
- Identify patterns in multi-domain tasks
- Refine scoring weights based on effectiveness
- Update keyword mappings as codebase evolves
- Expand domain definitions for new technologies
- Improve fallback strategies based on edge cases

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Commands not showing up

**Solution:**
1. Verify plugin is in correct directory: `.claude/plugins/jira-orchestrator/`
2. Restart Claude Code CLI
3. Check plugin.json is valid JSON

---

### Issue: Jira API connection fails

**Solution:**
1. Verify environment variables are set correctly
2. Check API token is valid and hasn't expired
3. Verify ATLASSIAN_SITE_URL format (include https://)
4. Test connection: `curl -u $ATLASSIAN_EMAIL:$ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN $ATLASSIAN_SITE_URL/rest/api/3/myself`

---

### Issue: Code review gate blocking PR

**Solution:**
This is by design. To proceed:
1. Run `/jira:review` to see review findings
2. Address all critical issues
3. Re-run review until it passes
4. Then create PR

---

### Issue: Hooks not triggering

**Solution:**
1. Ensure hooks are enabled in Claude Code settings
2. Check hook scripts are executable: `chmod +x hooks/scripts/*.sh`
3. Verify hook configuration in `hooks/hooks.json`
4. Check hook timeout settings

---

### Issue: Session state lost

**Solution:**
1. Run `/jira:sync` to restore from Jira
2. Check `sessions/active/` for session files
3. Use `/jira:status` to see active sessions
