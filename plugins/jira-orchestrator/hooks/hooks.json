Only suggest orchestration if it seems they want to actually work on the issue.\n\n## Detection Patterns\n\nLook for phrases like:\n- \"work on [ISSUE-KEY]\"\n- \"fix [ISSUE-KEY]\"\n- \"implement [ISSUE-KEY]\"\n- \"complete [ISSUE-KEY]\"\n- \"start [ISSUE-KEY]\"\n- \"help with [ISSUE-KEY]\"\n\n## Context Variables\n\n- `${DETECTED_ISSUES}`: Comma-separated list of detected Jira keys\n- `${USER_MESSAGE}`: The full user message\n- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`: Plugin root directory"
