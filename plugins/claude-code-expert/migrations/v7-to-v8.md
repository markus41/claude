## Commands (21 → 11)

| v7 command | Disposition | v8 destination | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| cc-agent | DELETE | — | Use Agent tool + `/cc-council` |
| cc-autonomy | KEEP | commands-v8/cc-autonomy | |
| cc-bootstrap | MERGE | commands-v8/cc-setup (--audit flag) | Bootstrap = audit subset of setup |
| cc-budget | DELETE | — | Covered by `/cc-intel` + MCP:cc_docs_compare |
| cc-channels | KEEP | commands-v8/cc-channels | |
| cc-cicd | DELETE | — | Covered by MCP:cc_kb_workflow_pack |
| cc-config | MERGE | commands-v8/cc-sync (--fix-drift flag) | Config drift = sync concern |
| cc-council | KEEP | commands-v8/cc-council | |
| cc-debug | MERGE | commands-v8/cc-debug | Absorbs cc-troubleshoot |
| cc-help | KEEP+upgrade | commands-v8/cc-help | Routing table |
| cc-hooks | KEEP | commands-v8/cc-hooks | |

| cc-learn | DELETE | — | Workflow packs via MCP:cc_kb_workflow_pack |
| cc-mcp | DELETE | — | Covered by `/cc-setup --mcp-only` |

| cc-setup | KEEP+upgrade | commands-v8/cc-setup | Absorbs cc-bootstrap via --audit |
| cc-sync | KEEP+upgrade | commands-v8/cc-sync | Absorbs cc-config via --fix-drift |
| cc-troubleshoot | MERGE | commands-v8/cc-debug | Debug and troubleshoot are one concern |

**Shim discipline (per §9 decision 1)**: deleted commands leave a stub `commands/cc-{name}.md` at v8.0 that prints "Renamed: use /cc-{replacement}" and runs the replacement. Stubs removed in v8.1.

**Result**: 21 v7 commands → 11 v8 commands + 10 shims (5 DELETE permanently, 5 MERGE into keepers with shim redirect).

## Reachability verification checklist (Phase 6 gate)

Every v7 asset marked DELETE or MERGE must have its content reachable through at least one of:
- [ ] A v8 skill body
- [ ] An MCP KB tool artifact
- [ ] An MCP reference tool (cc_docs_*)
- [ ] A v8 command body
- [ ] A v8 agent system prompt
- [ ] An external skill (documented in ULTRAPLAN.md §2.4 notes)

**Spot-check script** (runs at Phase 6 gate):
```bash
# Example: verify channels-bootstrap content is reachable
grep -r "HMAC-SHA256" mcp-server/kb/channels/ || fail "channel server content lost"
grep -r "topic_key" skills/cc-second-brain/ || fail "engram conventions lost"
grep -r "5 Whys" agents/debugger.md || fail "debug hypothesis protocol lost"
# ... (one assertion per DELETE/MERGE row above)
```
