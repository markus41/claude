## v7.5.0 (2026-03-31)

### New Commands (+1)

- **`/cc-channels`** — Event-driven channel bootstrap and management. Sub-commands:
  - `bootstrap [ci-webhook|mobile|discord|fakechat|--all]` — writes TypeScript channel server files, updates `.mcp.json`, prints step-by-step setup instructions per pattern
  - `security` — audits all registered channels for allowlist coverage, secret exposure, port binding, HMAC verification, and `.gitignore` hygiene
  - `status` — lists registered channels and last event timestamps
  - `test [name]` — sends a curl test event to a registered channel
  - `pair <code>` — confirms a device pairing code from mobile/Discord

### New Skills (+1)

- **`channels-bootstrap`** — 4 production-ready channel server implementations (TypeScript/Bun, copy-paste ready):
  - **CI Webhook Receiver** — HTTP POST listener with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, GitHub Actions event parsing (workflow_run, push, pull_request, deployment_status), smart filtering (only failure/merged/completed events), severity meta tagging. Includes ngrok and Cloudflare Tunnel setup.
  - **Mobile Approval Relay** — Full permission relay via Telegram (requires v2.1.81+). Long-poll Telegram API, allowlisted sender gate, pairing flow with expiring codes, persistent paired-chat state (`.claude/channels/mobile-approval-paired.json`), permission verdict parsing (`yes/no <id>`).
  - **Discord Bridge** — Two-way bidirectional bridge. `discord_reply` MCP tool for Claude to reply, allowlist-gated per-channel polling, 2000-char message splitting, permission relay forwarding, persistent paired-channel state.
  - **Fakechat Dev Profile** — Built-in channel startup commands, HTTP API for scripted test events, sample `test-channel.sh` bash script.
  - **Sender Allowlist Patterns** — Three patterns: env var (simple), file-based hot-reload (`allowlist.txt` via `watchFile`), pairing-based enrollment. Always gate on `user_id` not `chat_id`. Content sanitization (XML tag stripping, null bytes, length cap).
  - **Security Checklist** — 10-item pre-deployment checklist, `.gitignore` additions for paired files and allowlists.
