### New Skills (+3)

- **`auto-mode`** — Classifier-based auto permission handling. Covers the three permission modes (default/auto/bypassPermissions), Shift+Tab cycling, `defaultMode: "auto"` setting, how the classifier scores actions, `PermissionDenied` hook (with `retry: true`), and `defer` permissionDecision for SDK/headless workflows.
