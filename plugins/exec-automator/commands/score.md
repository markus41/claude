## ROI Calculation

For each scored responsibility, the command estimates ROI based on:

**Time Savings:**
```
Annual Hours Saved = (Current Hours per Instance) × (Instances per Year) × (Automation %)
Automation % = Score / 100 × Efficiency Factor
```

**Cost Savings:**
```
Annual Cost Savings = (Annual Hours Saved) × (Loaded Hourly Rate)
Loaded Hourly Rate = (Annual Compensation + Benefits + Overhead) / 2080
```

**Implementation Cost:**
```
One-Time Cost = (Development Hours) × (Developer Rate) + (Tool Licenses) + (Training)
Development Hours = Base Hours × (100 - Integration Complexity Score) / 50
```

**ROI Calculation:**
```
Simple ROI = (Annual Savings - Annual Recurring Costs) / One-Time Cost
Payback Period = One-Time Cost / (Annual Savings - Annual Recurring Costs)
3-Year NPV = Present Value of 3 Years of Savings - Total Costs
```

**Risk-Adjusted ROI:**
```
Risk Factor = 1 - (Error Impact × Implementation Risk)
Error Impact = (100 - Error Tolerance Score) / 100
Implementation Risk = (100 - Integration Complexity Score) / 200
Risk-Adjusted ROI = Simple ROI × Risk Factor
```

## Risk Assessment Matrix

Each responsibility is evaluated for automation risk:

### Technical Risk (Low/Medium/High)
- **Low**: Score 80+, proven integrations, simple workflows
- **Medium**: Score 50-79, custom integration, moderate complexity
- **High**: Score <50, complex systems, unproven technology

### Business Risk (Low/Medium/High)
- **Low**: Error Tolerance 80+, low customer/revenue impact
- **Medium**: Error Tolerance 50-79, moderate stakeholder impact
- **High**: Error Tolerance <50, high brand/legal/financial risk

### Change Management Risk (Low/Medium/High)
- **Low**: Clear value, minimal workflow disruption
- **Medium**: Moderate training required, some resistance expected
- **High**: Significant process change, cultural resistance
