## Financial Analysis

### ROI Calculation

**Formula:**
```
ROI = (Total Benefits - Total Costs) / Total Costs × 100%
```

**3-Year Calculation:**
```
Total Benefits (3 years):
  Direct cost savings:        ${direct_savings_3year}
  Cost avoidance:             ${cost_avoidance_3year}
  Revenue impact:             ${revenue_impact_3year}
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  Total Benefits:             ${total_benefits_3year}

Total Costs (3 years):
  Initial implementation:     ${implementation_cost}
  Operating costs (3 years):  ${operating_costs_3year}
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
  Total Costs:                ${total_costs_3year}

Net Value:                    ${net_value_3year}

## DATA COLLECTION FUNCTIONS

When generating reports, use these functions to gather required data:

### Function 1: Collect Automation Output Data

```bash
# Find all automation deployment reports
Glob pattern="**/automation-output/**/AUTOMATION-DEPLOYMENT-REPORT.md"

# Read the most recent deployment report
Read file_path="{most_recent_deployment_report_path}"

# Find all scoring data
Glob pattern="**/automation-output/**/automation-scores.json"
Read file_path="{scoring_file_path}"

# Find all ROI calculations
Glob pattern="**/automation-output/**/roi-calculations.json"
Read file_path="{roi_file_path}"

# Find deployment manifests
Glob pattern="**/automation-output/**/deployment-manifest.json"
Read file_path="{manifest_path}"
```

### Function 2: Collect Obsidian Documentation

```python
# Search for exec-automator projects
mcp__obsidian__obsidian_search(
    query="Projects/Exec-Automator",
    limit=100
)

# Get specific analysis files
mcp__obsidian__obsidian_get_file_contents(
    filepath="Projects/Exec-Automator/Analyses/{org-name}-analysis.md"
)

# Get scoring documentation
mcp__obsidian__obsidian_get_file_contents(
    filepath="Projects/Exec-Automator/Scoring/{org-name}-priorities.md"
)

# Get deployment documentation
mcp__obsidian__obsidian_get_file_contents(
    filepath="Projects/Exec-Automator/Deployments/{org-name}-production.md"
)
```

### Function 3: Collect Real-Time Monitoring Data

```python
# Get current execution metrics
mcp__exec-automator__monitor_execution(
    agent_id="all",
    metrics=[
        "execution_count",
        "success_rate",
        "avg_duration",
        "error_rate",
        "cost_per_execution",
        "total_cost"
    ],
    time_period="{period}"  # "current", "monthly", "quarterly", "annual"
)
```

### Function 4: Calculate Derived Metrics

After collecting raw data, calculate:

**Automation Coverage:**
```
automation_coverage_percentage = (automated_count / total_responsibilities_count) × 100
```

**Time Savings:**
```
hours_saved_per_month = sum(responsibility.hours_before - responsibility.hours_after)
annual_hours_saved = hours_saved_per_month × 12
```

**Cost Savings:**
```
monthly_cost_savings = hours_saved_per_month × hourly_rate
annual_cost_savings = monthly_cost_savings × 12
three_year_savings = annual_cost_savings × 3
```

**ROI:**
```
total_benefit = direct_savings + cost_avoidance + revenue_impact
total_cost = implementation_cost + (annual_operating_cost × 3)
roi_percentage = ((total_benefit - total_cost) / total_cost) × 100
```

**Payback Period:**
```
monthly_net_benefit = (annual_benefit / 12) - (annual_cost / 12)
payback_months = implementation_cost / monthly_net_benefit
```
