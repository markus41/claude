- CTA placement (top vs. middle vs. bottom)
- CTA wording ("Register Now" vs. "Save My Spot")
- Email design (image-heavy vs. text-focused)
- Personalization level (name only vs. dynamic content)
- Content types (stories vs. data vs. how-to)

3. Ensure sufficient sample size (min 1,000 per variant)
4. Run simultaneously to control for time factors
5. Set decision metric (open rate, CTR, conversions)
6. Measure statistical significance
7. Implement winner for future campaigns
8. Document results in testing log

### Content Audit Process

**Annual Content Audit (Q1):**
1. **Inventory All Content**
   - Website pages
   - Blog posts
   - Email templates
   - Social media profiles
   - Print materials
   - Video library

2. **Assess Each Asset**
   - Accuracy (outdated information?)

   - Performance (how's it doing?)
   - SEO (optimized?)
   - Accessibility (compliant?)
   - Brand alignment (on-voice?)

3. **Categorize Actions**
   - **Keep**: Performing well, accurate, relevant
   - **Update**: Good but needs refresh
   - **Consolidate**: Merge with similar content
   - **Delete**: Outdated, redundant, or poor performer
   - **Create**: Gap identified, needed content missing

4. **Create Action Plan**
   - Prioritize updates by traffic and importance
   - Assign ownership
   - Set deadlines
   - Track completion

5. **Implement Changes**
   - Update content
   - Redirect or remove deleted pages

## Error Handling and Edge Cases

### Email Deliverability Issues

**High Bounce Rate:**
- Clean list: Remove hard bounces immediately
- Verify email addresses at signup
- Use double opt-in
- Segment and send to engaged users first
- Check for typos in domain configurations
- Warm up new IP addresses gradually

**Low Open Rates:**
- Test different subject lines
- Verify sender name recognition
- Check spam score before send
- Segment more granularly
- Send at different times
- Re-engage inactive subscribers or remove them

**Spam Complaints:**
- Immediately investigate complaint source
- Review content for spam triggers
- Ensure clear unsubscribe option
- Verify list acquisition methods
- Reduce frequency if too high
- Improve targeting and relevance

**Blacklisting:**
- Check blacklist status: MXToolbox, MultiRBL
- Identify cause (spam complaints, poor list hygiene, compromised account)
- Request delisting after fixing issue
- Implement SPF, DKIM, DMARC authentication
- Monitor sender reputation continuously

### Crisis Communication Challenges

**Rapidly Evolving Situation:**
- Stick to facts known at time
- Update frequently with timestamps
- Create dedicated crisis webpage
- Use social media for real-time updates
- Hold regular press briefings if major crisis

**Legal Constraints:**
- Work closely with legal counsel
- Understand what can and cannot be said
- Use approved language only

- Have legal review before publishing

**Internal Disagreement on Messaging:**
- Escalate to executive director or board chair
- Seek legal counsel if liability involved

- Document decision-making process

**Social Media Backlash:**
- Monitor continuously
- Respond to legitimate concerns
- Ignore trolls and bad actors
- Provide consistent messaging
- Escalate threats to appropriate authorities
- Don't engage in arguments publicly

### Content Production Delays

**Writer/Designer Unavailable:**
- Maintain backup content calendar
- Have emergency content templates ready
- Cross-train team members
- Use freelancers/contractors as backup
- Pull from content library if needed

**Late Approvals:**
- Set clear deadlines with buffer
- Use approval workflows with auto-escalation
- Limit number of approvers
- Empower communicator to make decisions
- Document approval authority by content type

**Technical Issues (Platform Down):**
- Have backup platform identified
- Export content and lists regularly
- Maintain plain-text versions
- Use multiple distribution channels
- Communicate delays to audience if significant
