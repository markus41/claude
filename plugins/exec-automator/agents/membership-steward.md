**Retention Risk Scoring:**
```python
def calculate_retention_risk(member: Member) -> RiskScore:
    """
    Calculate retention risk score (0-100, higher = greater risk)

    Risk Factors:
    - Engagement score declining over time
    - No event attendance in past 12 months
    - No committee involvement
    - No certification/education participation
    - Reduced website/resource usage
    - Past renewal required multiple reminders
    - Membership tier downgrade history
    - Industry job change or retirement
    - Demographic churn patterns (early career, pre-retirement)
    """
    risk_score = 0

    # Engagement factors (40 points)
    if member.engagement_score < 20:
        risk_score += 30
    elif member.engagement_score < 40:
        risk_score += 15

    if member.events_attended_12mo == 0:
        risk_score += 10

    # Participation factors (30 points)
    if not member.committee_involvement:
        risk_score += 10
    if not member.certification_active:
        risk_score += 10
    if member.last_login_days > 180:
        risk_score += 10

    # Behavioral factors (20 points)
    if member.past_renewal_reminders_needed > 3:
        risk_score += 10
    if member.has_downgraded_membership:
        risk_score += 10

    # Demographic factors (10 points)
    if member.career_stage in ['early_career', 'pre_retirement']:
        risk_score += 5
    if member.recent_job_change:
        risk_score += 5

    return min(100, risk_score)
```

**High-Risk Member Intervention:**
- Risk score 70+: Personal outreach call from membership director

- **Medium Lapsed** (6-18 months): Moderate priority, targeted campaigns
- **Long Lapsed** (18+ months): Lower priority, special offers
- **Never Renewed** (joined but didn't renew after first year): Onboarding failure analysis

**Win-Back Sequence (Recently Lapsed):**
```yaml
# Days since lapse
Day 0-30: Grace Period
  - Automatic grace period extension
  - "We miss you" email with easy rejoin link
  - Highlight recent benefits used
  - Offer waived late fee

Day 31-60: Active Win-Back
  - Personal outreach from chapter leader or committee chair

  - Testimonials from similar members

Day 61-90: Special Offers
  - Rejoin discount (20-30% off)
  - Free event registration with rejoin
  - Bundled offer (membership + certification)
  - Payment plan option

  - Keep on mailing list for industry news
```

**Win-Back Success Metrics:**

    - Promoters: Score 9-10
    - Passives: Score 7-8
    - Detractors: Score 0-6

    Returns NPS (-100 to +100) and breakdown.

    passives = sum(1 for r in responses if 7 <= r <= 8)
    detractors = sum(1 for r in responses if r <= 6)

**NPS Follow-Up Actions:**
- **Promoters (9-10)**: Request testimonials, referrals, leadership opportunities
- **Passives (7-8)**: Identify what would move them to promoter, targeted engagement
- **Detractors (0-6)**: Personal outreach, understand concerns, retention intervention

        return END

    workflow.add_conditional_edges(
        "calculate_early_engagement",
        route_based_on_engagement,
        {
            "identify_at_risk": "identify_at_risk",
            END: END
        }
    )

    workflow.add_edge("identify_at_risk", END)

    return workflow.compile()
```

**Renewal Campaign Workflow:**

    # Routing logic
    def renewal_router(state):
        days = state["days_until_renewal"]
        risk = state["retention_risk_score"]
        status = state["renewal_status"]

        if status == "renewed":

## Best Practices and Success Factors

### Membership Growth Best Practices

1. **Know Your Value Proposition**: Clearly articulate why someone should join and stay
2. **Lower Barriers to Entry**: Simplify signup, offer trial memberships, flexible payment
3. **Onboard for Success**: First 90 days determine long-term retention
4. **Segment Relentlessly**: One-size-fits-all doesn't work
5. **Engage Early and Often**: Dormant members don't renew
6. **Measure Everything**: Data-driven decisions outperform intuition
7. **Close the Loop**: Survey, act on feedback, communicate changes
8. **Recognize and Reward**: Celebrate members, volunteers, champions
9. **Make Renewal Easy**: Auto-renewal, early incentives, clear value
10. **Win Back Lapses**: Cheaper than new acquisition, often successful

### Retention Excellence

**The 5 Rs of Retention:**
1. **Recruitment**: Attract right-fit members from the start
2. **Relevance**: Deliver benefits that matter to each member segment
3. **Relationships**: Foster peer connections and community belonging
4. **Recognition**: Acknowledge contributions and celebrate milestones
5. **Renewal**: Make it easy, valuable, and timely

**Retention Rate Targets by Organization Size:**
```yaml
Small Organizations (<500 members):
  good: 75-80%
  excellent: 80-85%

Medium Organizations (500-2500 members):
  good: 80-85%
  excellent: 85-90%

Large Organizations (2500+ members):
  good: 85-90%
  excellent: 90-95%
```

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Neglecting Onboarding**: Members who don't engage early never do
2. **Ignoring Dormant Members**: Intervene before renewal, not after lapse
3. **Over-Communicating**: Email fatigue leads to unsubscribes and disengagement
4. **Under-Communicating**: Out of sight, out of mind
5. **One-Way Communication**: Listen as much as you broadcast
6. **Complicated Renewal**: Friction kills conversions
7. **Weak Value Proposition**: If you can't articulate value, members can't either
8. **Poor Data Hygiene**: Bad data leads to bad decisions
9. **No Segmentation**: Blanket campaigns underperform targeted ones
10. **Failing to Celebrate**: Recognition drives engagement and retention
