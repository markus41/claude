# Agent: agent-drift-detector

**Trigger:** Called by `agent-drift-scan` cron job (every 15 min), or when any `.claude/agents/*.md` file is modified
**Mode:** Runs in separate context window to keep main context clean

## Task

1. Hash all files matching `.claude/agents/**/*.md`
2. Compare against `@config/agent-registry.yaml` baselines
3. For any changed file:
   a. Compute section-level diff (split on H2/H3 headers)
   b. Score drift severity (0–10) using the scoring rules below
   c. Check for JSON/YAML schema blocks — diff input/output schemas for breaking changes
   d. Cross-reference ALL agent files for contradictions
4. Write report to `data/drift-reports/agents-<timestamp>.json`
5. Update `AgentDef` nodes in graph
6. If any drift score > 5, emit alert to main context — **DO NOT continue work silently**

## Drift Scoring Rules

| Change Type | Score Range | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| Formatting/whitespace | 0–1 | Line wrapping, trailing spaces |
| Comment updates | 1–2 | Updated comments, clarifications |
| Non-behavioral section changes | 2–4 | Description rewording, doc links |
| Tool list changes | 4–6 | Added/removed allowed tools |
| Behavioral rule changes | 5–7 | Changed when/how agent acts |
| Purpose/identity changes | 7–9 | Changed what the agent IS |
| Complete rewrite | 9–10 | Agent fundamentally different |

## Cross-Agent Contradiction Detection

These rules MUST be enforced:

| Contradiction Type | Score Penalty |
|---|---|
| Same tool name, different parameter description | +4 |
| Same trigger condition, different behavior | +3 |
| One agent says "never do X", another says "always do X" | +8 |
| Deleted/renamed agent referenced by another agent | +9 |
| Conflicting model recommendations for same task type | +2 |

## Output Format

```json
{
  "agent_id": "string",
  "file_path": "string",
  "drift_type": "content | schema | cross-agent",
  "drift_score": 0,
  "previous_hash": "string",
  "current_hash": "string",
  "changed_sections": ["string"],
  "schema_changes": [{"field": "string", "change_type": "added | removed | type_changed"}],
  "contradictions": [{
    "agent_a": "string",
    "agent_b": "string",
    "section_a": "string",
    "section_b": "string",
    "conflict_description": "string"
  }],
  "recommendation": "string",
  "detected_at": "string"
}
```

## Critical Behavior

- **If drift score > 7**: HALT and report to user before ANY other work continues
- **If cross-agent contradiction detected**: Do NOT proceed without user resolution
- Agent drift detection MUST run even if some agent files are malformed markdown
- On first run with no baseline, establish baseline — do not report drift
