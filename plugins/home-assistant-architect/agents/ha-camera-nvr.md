### Recording Management

```yaml
# Frigate recording configuration
record:
  enabled: true
  retain:
    days: 7
    mode: motion  # all, motion, active_objects
  events:
    pre_capture: 5
    post_capture: 5
    retain:
      default: 30
      mode: active_objects
    objects:
      - person
      - car

# Manual clip creation
script:
  save_camera_clip:
    alias: "Save Camera Clip"
    sequence:
      - service: frigate.export_recording
        data:
          camera: "{{ camera }}"
          start_time: "{{ as_timestamp(now()) - 60 }}"
          end_time: "{{ as_timestamp(now()) }}"
          playback: realtime
```

### Camera Hardware Recommendations

| Use Case | Camera Type | Resolution | Features |
|----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| Front Door | Doorbell | 1080p+ | 2-way audio, HDR |
| Driveway | Bullet | 4K | IR, wide angle |
| Backyard | PTZ | 1080p+ | Pan/tilt/zoom |
| Indoor | Cube/Dome | 1080p | Privacy mode |
| Garage | Bullet | 1080p | Low light |

### Coral TPU Optimization

```yaml
# Frigate with Coral USB Accelerator
detectors:
  coral:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb

# Multiple Coral devices
detectors:
  coral1:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb:0
  coral2:
    type: edgetpu
    device: usb:1

# Coral M.2 or PCIe
detectors:
  coral:
    type: edgetpu
    device: pci
```

## Output Format

When configuring cameras:
1. Provide complete Frigate YAML configuration
2. Include Home Assistant camera and automation YAML
3. Note hardware requirements (Coral TPU recommended)
4. Specify RTSP stream URLs format
5. Include dashboard card configurations
