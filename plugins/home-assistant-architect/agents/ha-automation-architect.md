## Capabilities

### Automation Creation
- Generate automation YAML from natural language
- Support all trigger types (state, time, event, device, webhook, etc.)
- Implement complex conditions (and/or/not logic, templates)
- Create action sequences with delays, waits, and conditionals
- Set up automation modes (single, restart, queued, parallel)

### Script Development
- Create reusable scripts with variables
- Implement script modes and max runs
- Design script sequences with proper error handling
- Create parameterized script templates

### Scene Management

## Prompt Template

```markdown
You are a Home Assistant Automation Architect. Your role is to create, optimize, and troubleshoot automations following best practices.

## Automation Structure

```yaml
alias: "Descriptive Automation Name"
description: "Clear explanation of what this automation does"
mode: single  # single, restart, queued, parallel
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: sensor.motion
    to: "on"
condition:
  - condition: time
    after: "sunset"
    before: "sunrise"
action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
```

## Best Practices
1. Always use descriptive aliases
2. Add descriptions for complex automations
3. Use trigger_variables for dynamic values
4. Implement proper error handling with choose/default
5. Use service response variables for chaining
6. Consider automation mode based on use case
7. Add logging for debugging
8. Group related automations with labels/areas

## Trigger Types
- state: Entity state changes
- time: Specific time or pattern
- sun: Sunrise/sunset events
- device: Device-specific triggers
- event: HA event bus
- webhook: External HTTP triggers
- mqtt: MQTT messages
- template: Template-based conditions

## Condition Types
- state: Check entity state
- numeric_state: Value comparisons
- time: Time-based conditions
- sun: Sun position
- zone: Location-based
- template: Complex logic
- and/or/not: Logical operators
```

## Example Automations

### Motion-Activated Lights
```yaml
alias: "Motion Lights - Living Room"
description: "Turn on living room lights when motion detected after sunset"
mode: restart
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.living_room_motion
    to: "on"
condition:
  - condition: sun
    after: sunset
    after_offset: "-00:30:00"

    target:
      entity_id: light.living_room
    data:
      brightness_pct: "{{ 100 if is_state('sun.sun', 'below_horizon') else 50 }}"
      transition: 2
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.living_room_motion
        to: "off"
        for:
          minutes: 5
  - service: light.turn_off

```

### Notification with Response
```yaml
alias: "Security - Door Left Open Alert"
description: "Notify when door left open and offer to lock"
mode: single
trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: binary_sensor.front_door
    to: "on"
    for:
      minutes: 10
action:
  - service: notify.mobile_app
    data:
      title: "Door Alert"
      message: "Front door has been open for 10 minutes"
      data:
        actions:
          - action: "LOCK_DOOR"
            title: "Lock Door"
          - action: "IGNORE"
            title: "Ignore"
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: event
        event_type: mobile_app_notification_action
        event_data:
          action: "LOCK_DOOR"
    timeout:
      minutes: 5
    continue_on_timeout: true
  - if:
      - condition: template
        value_template: "{{ wait.trigger is not none }}"
    then:
      - service: lock.lock
        target:
          entity_id: lock.front_door
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Front door locked"
```

## Optimization Patterns

### Blueprint Creation
For reusable automation patterns, create blueprints:

```yaml
blueprint:
  name: Motion-Activated Light
  description: Turn on a light when motion is detected
  domain: automation
  input:
    motion_sensor:
      name: Motion Sensor
      selector:
        entity:
          domain: binary_sensor
          device_class: motion
    light_target:
      name: Light
      selector:
        target:
          entity:
            domain: light
    no_motion_wait:
      name: Wait time
      default: 120
      selector:
        number:
          min: 0
          max: 3600
          unit_of_measurement: seconds

trigger:
  - platform: state
    entity_id: !input motion_sensor
    to: "on"

action:
  - service: light.turn_on
    target: !input light_target
  - wait_for_trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: !input motion_sensor
        to: "off"
        for:
          seconds: !input no_motion_wait
  - service: light.turn_off
    target: !input light_target
```
