# Agentic Design Patterns — Upgrade Suggestion

> Patterns from "Agentic Design Patterns" (Gulli & Sauco, 2025) applied to AI-powered codebase upgrade intelligence

## Applied Patterns

### Reflection
**Relevance**: Upgrade analysis requires not just identifying what could change, but critiquing the quality of that analysis — an overly eager upgrade recommendation without considering migration cost is as harmful as missing a critical security fix.
**Current Implementation**: The plugin performs 8-dimension analysis (security, performance, DX, UX, architecture, code quality, innovation, tech debt) with each dimension producing evidence-based scores and rationale.
**Enhancement**: Apply self-critique reflection after the initial analysis pass — have a secondary reasoning step review each dimension's output for: (a) uncited claims, (b) upgrade recommendations that ignore breaking changes, (c) confidence scores inconsistent with evidence density. The refined output replaces the first-pass draft before surfacing to the user.

### Multi-Agent (Council Pattern)
**Relevance**: A single model evaluating all 8 dimensions introduces bias — the model that finds a brilliant security fix may downplay performance regressions. Specialized agents reduce blind spots.
**Current Implementation**: A multi-agent council coordinates the analysis, with different agents handling distinct dimensions, orchestrated through the council review workflow.
**Enhancement**: Formalize the council pattern with structured dissent — each dimension agent produces an assessment AND a challenge brief that a devil's-advocate agent uses to stress-test the recommendation. The council chair synthesizes agreements, negotiates conflicts, and flags irresolvable disagreements for user review.

### Parallelization
**Relevance**: 8-dimension analysis of a large codebase is time-consuming when run sequentially. Dimensions are largely independent and can proceed concurrently.
**Current Implementation**: Concurrent dimension analysis runs agent workstreams in parallel, dramatically reducing total analysis time.
**Enhancement**: Implement result streaming parallelization — completed dimensions surface immediately as they finish rather than waiting for the slowest dimension, giving the user progressive visibility into findings. A dependency layer ensures dimensions that inform others (security findings that affect architecture recommendations) complete in the right order.

### Reasoning (Evidence-Based Scoring)
**Relevance**: An upgrade suggestion without traceable reasoning is untrustworthy — developers need to know why a library is flagged, not just that it is.
**Current Implementation**: The plugin produces evidence-based confidence scores backed by codebase fingerprinting, usage analysis, and framework-specific knowledge.
**Enhancement**: Apply chain-of-thought reasoning traces — each score surfaces the 3-5 evidence items that drove it, ranked by weight, so developers can challenge the reasoning and the system can be corrected without a full re-analysis.

### Evaluation
**Relevance**: Upgrade intelligence is only as good as its accuracy. The system must evaluate its own recommendations against ground truth (past upgrades, known breaking changes, actual migration effort).
**Current Implementation**: Confidence scoring and tech debt forecasting quantify uncertainty. The impact preview feature shows before/after states.
**Enhancement**: Implement self-evaluation against a known-outcomes corpus — when the user acts on a suggestion (or explicitly rejects it with feedback), that outcome is stored and used to calibrate future confidence scores for similar patterns. This creates a learning loop that improves precision over time.

### Planning (Upgrade Roadmaps)
**Relevance**: A list of upgrade suggestions without sequencing is a backlog, not a plan. Dependencies between upgrades (upgrade A before B; C and D can be batched) must be explicit.
**Current Implementation**: The plugin generates upgrade roadmaps with phased sequencing, batching compatible upgrades and separating high-risk changes.
**Enhancement**: Apply formal dependency-aware planning — model the upgrade space as a directed acyclic graph where edges represent compatibility dependencies. The roadmap planner finds the optimal topological ordering that minimizes re-work while maximizing parallelism within each phase.

### Resource-Aware (Model Routing)
**Relevance**: Not all 8 dimensions require the same analytical depth. A routine patch-level version bump needs less reasoning than a major framework migration recommendation.
**Current Implementation**: Model routing selects analysis depth based on upgrade complexity and dimension criticality, using lightweight models for straightforward checks and deeper reasoning for complex architectural recommendations.
**Enhancement**: Apply dynamic resource allocation — the orchestrator monitors token usage per dimension in real time and reallocates budget from low-signal dimensions to high-signal ones. If security analysis is producing dense findings, it gets more tokens; if UX analysis finds nothing noteworthy, it exits early and cedes its budget.

**Flow**: Parallel dimension agents (Parallelization) run concurrently under budget control (Resource-Aware). Each agent produces evidence-traced reasoning (Reasoning) that feeds the council (Multi-Agent). The council applies self-critique (Reflection), yielding calibrated scores (Evaluation) that feed into sequenced roadmaps (Planning). User outcomes loop back to recalibrate future evaluations.
