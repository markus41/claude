## Two flavours

| Type | Storage | Use case |
|------|---------|----------|
| File attachment | Linear S3 (pre-signed) | screenshots, logs, design files |
| Link attachment | External URL only | GitHub PR, Figma, Notion, Loom |

## File upload (3-step)

```ts
// 1. Reserve upload URL
const reservation = await client.fileUpload({
  contentType: "image/png",
  filename: "screenshot.png",
  size: file.length
});
// { uploadFile: { uploadUrl, headers: [{key,value}], assetUrl } }

// 2. PUT bytes
await fetch(reservation.uploadUrl, {
  method: "PUT",
  body: file,
  headers: Object.fromEntries(reservation.headers.map(h => [h.key, h.value]))
});

// 3. Attach to issue
await client.attachmentCreate({
  issueId,
  url: reservation.assetUrl,
  title: "Screenshot",
  contentType: "image/png"
});
```

Helper in `lib/attachment-upload.ts`:
```ts
export async function uploadFileToLinear(
  client: LinearClient,
  issueId: string,
  filePath: string,
  title?: string
): Promise<string>;  // returns attachment ID
```

## Multipart for large files

For files >50MB:
- Linear's pre-signed URL supports multipart S3 uploads
- Split into 5MB parts, PUT each with `partNumber` query param
- Complete with `POST ?uploads` to finalise

Most use cases stay under 50MB; only logs and video do this.

## Link attachments

```ts
await client.attachmentLinkCreate(issueId, "https://github.com/org/repo/pull/42", "PR #42");
```

Linear infers preview from URL pattern. Supported: GitHub PR / issue / commit, Figma, Notion, Loom, Vimeo, Slack thread, generic OG-rich pages.

## Download with auth

Asset URLs require the same Linear token in `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Don't share these URLs publicly — they expire after 7 days but exposing during that window is a leak.

```ts
const res = await fetch(assetUrl, {
  headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.LINEAR_API_KEY}` }
});
const buffer = Buffer.from(await res.arrayBuffer());
```

Or, mint a short-lived signed URL through your own service if you need to share with end users.

## Bridge fan-out

- **Harness Code**: file attachments are linked (not copied) to the linked PR via a comment with the asset URL — the URL is auth-required, so reviewers must be Linear members.
- **MS Planner**: attachments uploaded to Linear are mirrored to OneDrive/SharePoint via Microsoft Graph `driveItem` upload. The Planner task `references` field gets the OneDrive URL.

## Security notes

- Validate content-type before declaring it (don't trust user input)
- Cap upload size at the layer above (usually 100MB)
- Strip EXIF from images if client-side is feasible
- Don't pass user file bytes through your backend; redirect them to Linear's pre-signed URL directly
