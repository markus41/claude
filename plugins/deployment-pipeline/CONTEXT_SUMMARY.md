# deployment-pipeline Context Summary

## Plugin purpose
Harness CD integration pipeline with state-machine workflow orchestration

## Command index
- `commands/approve.md`
- `commands/history.md`
- `commands/rollback.md`
- `commands/start.md`
- `commands/status.md`

## Agent index
- `agents/orchestrator.md`

## When-to-load guidance

- Open specific command/agent files only when the user asks for those workflows.
- Defer `skills/**` and long `README.md` documents until implementation details are needed.
