If any issues are found, provide a clear warning to the user with specific recommendations for improvement.\n\nIf the component looks good, briefly confirm it follows the patterns.\n\nDo not make changes unless explicitly asked - just validate and report."

Check if corresponding test files exist (e.g., Button.tsx -> Button.test.tsx or Button.spec.tsx)\n\n2. Remind the user:\n   - To run existing tests: `npm test` or `pnpm test`\n   - To write tests if missing, covering:\n     - Component renders without errors\n     - Props are handled correctly\n     - User interactions work as expected\n     - Accessibility features are present\n\n3. Suggest running test coverage: `npm test -- --coverage`\n\nIf no component files were changed, or if tests were already written/run during the session, you can skip this reminder.\n\nKeep the reminder brief and actionable."
